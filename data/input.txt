most of what happens happens beyond words the lexicon of lip and fingertip defies translation into common speech i recognize the musk of your dark hair it always thrills me though i cant describe it my finger on your thigh does not touch skin it touches your skin warming to my touch you are a language i have learned by heart this intimate patois will vanish with us its only native speakers does it matter our tribal chants our dances round the fire performed the sorcery we most required they bound us in a spell time could not break let the young vaunt their ecstasy we keep our tribe of two in sovereign secrecy what must be lost was never lost on us im alone until im asleep and there you are naked you take my hand shhhh we tiptoe through a black blue meadow to the pond behind the farmhouse the farmer sleeps in the blind window no cicadas even maybe just maybe venus this is before wednesday everythings alright we tiptoe round the house as around a painful subject were at the pond and now its time to use vague holy man speech like i am another face in your hand the face of your eye wing surrogates the wordbones its time for afternoon them white blank architectures no veil nothings glistening christmas christmas its time for you to forgive me i was forced to eat valises that wouldnt close by themselves that was just a dream good morning regurgitate the stars and the soot how can i that girl standing there my attention fixon roman or on russianor on spanish politics yet heres a travelled man that knowswhat he talks about and theres a politicianthat has both read and thought and maybe what they say is trueof war and wars alarms but o that i were young againand held her in my arms but sometimes i forget where i am imagine myself inside that life again recalcitrant mornings sun perhaps or more likely colorless light filtering its way through shapeless cloud and when i begin to believe i havent left the rest comes back our couch my smoke climbing the walls while the hours fall straining against the noise of traffic music anything alive to catch your key in the door and that scamper of feeling in my chest as if the day the night wherever it is i am by then has been only a whir of something other than waiting we hear so much about what love feels like right now today with the rain outside and leaves that want as much as i do to believe in may in seasons that come when called its impossible not to want to walk into the next room and let you run your hands down the sides of my legs knowing perfectly well what they know my silks and fine array my smiles and languishd air by love are drivn away and mournful lean despair brings me yew to deck my grave such end true lovers have his face is fair as heavn when springing buds unfold o why to him wast givn whose heart is wintry cold his breast is loves all worshipd tomb where all loves pilgrims come bring me an axe and spade bring me a winding sheet when i my grave have made let winds and tempests beat then down ill lie as cold as clay true love doth pass away peach of a grape in his fingertips like holding home he noses its musktaste he says and parts my lips with a globe and a thumb i lick i bite the thick skin his arkansas aches sweet on my tongue his hand vines my chin my throatmy face flames to the lady on the bus he brags her blush comes from my touch better to marry than to burn she quotes she dont know us when we gathered at the house while the men all looked at their shoes and the women whispered baby baby baby she sat down with a fist full of paper napkins and folded them into birds when she filled her hands she crossed the room to the hearth and threw a bird into the flames then another then another until she had destroyed all she created years later when i asked her what she meant she couldnt remember the worst has already happened she said what good is metaphor to us now what am i to think now the white scut of her bottom disappearing down the half flight carpet stair to the bathroom what am i to do with this masted image i put all my doubt to the mouth of her long body let her draw the night out of me like a thorn she touched it and it moved thats all remember me the murmuring lips half saidin half light buried in the hollowa boys neck made as now inside his headthey stir again though twenty years swallow the purest parts of her all but her plea this taunt what act from him could it command the boy whod know is gone re member me but what man can assemble limbs make standagain those legs that twined in his or hitchthe yoke of hips to sway and resurrect a girl i try but only recollecther scar each lewd profaning cautered stitch vermiform red furrowed belly to breast where nights long past hed laid his head in rest a winter evening at the cottage by the bay and i sat in the black and gold of the dead garden wrapped in blankets eating my sisters suet pudding the fountain was wrapped in dirty straw and just below my property in the old tartar cemetery there was a small funeral in progress the widow is wearing a purple shawl the children are bare around the shoulders and the girls are wearing orange petals at their throats the ashen white beards of the men are like immaculate vests from this distance there is nothing more intolerable than suet pudding unless it is the visitors the drunken visitors laughing in my kitchen eating my duck and venison while i hide from them here in the dark garden the daughter of one of these gentlemen is pretty i saw her through the window drinking champagne from a clay mug just under her thin blouse i saw the blue points of her breasts that turn in opposition both out and up like the azure slippers of the priest who is now singing in the cemetery below my house once the family has gone off with its torches ill climb down to the fresh grave and drop some coins for flowers even wooden teeth for the widow so she can attract a new husband the black turned soil or our garden reminds me of the common grave given to the children of the godunov orphanage after that horrible fire a charred horse was thrown in with them bags of lime and what i understood to be a large ham that the authorities nevertheless declared the torso of a male child of nine or ten the czar in their memory placed a tiny trout pond over them and this inscription a blue blanket for my little ones my wife goes nearly naked to parties in moscow my sister here at yalta goes sea bathing with a rope around her that runs back to the beach where it is attached to a donkey who is commanded by a servant with a long switch the sea tows her out and then the donkey is whipped sorrowfully until he has dragged her back to them i named the donkey moon after the mystery of his service to my sister this winter he has been an excellent friend i read to this poor beast from three sisters he is a better critic and audience than i could find in the cities i have won an award that will save me from arrest anywhere inside russia i am going to refuse it and then travel to nice or paris my tuberculosis is worse tolstoi reads my stories to his family after supper and reads them badly i suppose i did walk that evening all the way down to the cemetery only to discover that my pockets were empty i screamed up to the house for coins for plenty of coins the visitors laughing and singing ran down to me without coats and with a lantern swinging my sister trailed behind them on her donkey her square black hat bobbing like a steamer way out in the bay and when they reached me i said sister pack the trunks you hurt me i will write that we have departed for france for italy plum black the blush white of an apple shoulder melon cream in tones to list the flesh in light washed colors off at last textures sheer with damp i slowly pull from you with your quick help weekends ample procrastinations to forget the least of what we want to do april half a blast of cold half new light green simple now dusk now fear we pencil what we owe on this short form our numbers good enough the goose neck glare undoes how we spent the day each bite each bee sting kiss each bitten o all aftertaste later at the drop off postmark queue we joke now we can die drunken laughter escapes behind the fence woven with honeysuckle up to where i stand daddys running buddy carson is beside him in the time it takes to turn watch a woman tiptoe pull a sheer blouse off the clothesline to see her sun lit dress ride up peasant legs like the last image of mercy three are drinking from the mason jar thats the oak we planted the day before i left town as if father son needed staking down to earth if anything could now plumb distance that tree comes close recounting lost friends as they turn into mist the woman stands in a kitchen folding a mans trousers her chin tucked to hold the cuffs straight im lonely as those storytellers in my fathers backyard i shall join soon alone as they are tilting back heads to let the burning ease down the names of women melt in their mouths like hot mints as if we didnt know old man paggets stoopdown is doctored with slivers of red devil lye the man who married magdalene had not forgiven her god might pardon every sin love is no pardoner her hands were hollow pale and blue her mouth like watered wine he watched to see if she were true and waited for a sign it was old harlotry he guessed that drained her strength away so gladly for the dark she dressed so sadly for the day their quarrels made her dull and weak and soon a man might fit a penny in the hollow cheek and never notice it at last as they exhausted slept death granted the divorce and nakedly the woman leapt upon that narrow horse but when he woke and woke alone he wept and would deny the loose behavior of the bone and the immodest thigh seems lak to me de stars dont shine so bright seems lak to me de sun done loss his light seems lak to me ders nothin goin right sence you went away seems lak to me de sky aint half so

the world was open to my sorrow and ate most of it that today is a gift and i am ready to receive you in a cerulean ruckus of quilts we played house off the big room where they laughed slowdragged weekends the eagle flies on friday the jukebox pulsed a rainbow through the papery walls we were paid a dollar to guard each other i was eight s c mae fourteen as we experimented with the devil mill workers changed money in the briny glow of bootleg overpowered by the smell of collards catfish candied yams granddaddy gabriel worked the cash register beside his second wife rosie belle i heard my mother father laugh like swimmers underwater a raw odor of lilies sweat filled the room my cousins hands moved over me smooth tough as a blues guitar somebody swore they saw a silhouette with a gasoline can the night s c mae ran away with a womans husband for weeks they sifted ashes but the gutted studs braces only leaned against the wind weak as a boy girl entwined on the floor that june granddaddy drove a busload up north the growers paid him a dollar a day for each pair of hands he wanted to rebuild those nights their circle of blurred cards the bus grunted between orchards by late august i had enough fire blackened nickels dimes to fill a sock but only a few pickers came back after a season of wine stained greenbacks sewn inside coats taped to the soles of their feet anne identified with cate until it became a bona fide illness for boris had left cate resulting not only in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream of hostility directed not at boris but at his new woman anne whom cate viewed as her rival cate remained excessively tender with boris though cate for him had been a totem animal from which he gained power by eating whereas boris was the patriarch anne was the ego alien and whereas cate was annes fixation anne was no ones obsession so she was admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden associations she could not be induced to abandon on the rare occasions she slept the manifest and latent content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment between boris and cate which anne in her waking hours projected onto the walls as though screening a silent film she could not be induced to abandon this footage she could not be induced to abandon her object love of boris whose own object choice was his ego libido or her identification with cate who felt no friendship towards anne soon anne drew a mental triangle on every surface she saw be it phallic or concave and sometimes this triangle was isosceles sometimes it was equilateral and often it was right humane borders water station by delilah montoya far from highways i flicker gold the whispering gasoline if i pinch her nipples too hard no joy for her no joy for me so i practice on ticks press them just so so they give but do not burst beneath my boots thistle puncture vine a wild horse asleep on all fours its shadow still grazing my lips black meat my tongue black meat in my backpack sardine tins saltines a few cough drops the moon is my library theres a glacier inside a grain of salt do you understand im sorry my albanian isnt very good tremble if god forgets you tremble if god remembers you out of clay i shape sparrows i glaze their bills claws i give them names like gossamer inglenook lagoon she bathed a trumpet in milk her tenderness acoustic plural her pupils perched in all that green theres nudity around the corner bones cracked iridescent sometimes it rains so hard even the moon puts on a raincoat zinc razz zinc jazz i notch my arms i notch my thighs five six days i score my skin but not the back of my knees two ovals two portraits my son at ten his eyes ablaze my son at one his eyes shut once i dressed him in burlap once bicycles marbles once i tore rain out of a parable to strike down his thirst if the nose of the pig in the market of firenze has lost its matte patina and shines brassy even in the half light if the mosaic saint on the tiles of the basilica floor is half gone worn by the gravity of solid soles the passing of piety if the arms of venus have reentered the rubble taken by time her perennial lover mutilating even the memory of beauty and if the mother hiding with her child from the death squads of brutality if she trying to keep the child quiet to keep them from being found out holds her hand over his mouth holds him against her tighter and tighter until he stops breathing if the restorer trying to bring back to perfection the masterpiece scarred by its transit through time wipes away by mistake the mysterious smile if what loves and love is takes away what it aims to preserve then here is the place to fall silent meaning well but in danger of marring what we would praise unable to do more than wear down the marble steps to the altar smother the fire we would keep from the winds extinction or if afraid of our fear we lift the lid from the embers and send abroad into the parched night a flight of sparks incendiary dying to catch somewhere hungry for fuel the past its dry provision tinder for brilliance and heat prelude to cold and to ash why is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance aside to new found methods and to compounds strange why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told they thought the trouble was over they thought they had talked it all out it was a mistake shed said this infatuation for someone else which had turned suddenly too serious she could see that now but they thought there was nothing left of it their nerves had been rubbed so raw through bouts of anger shame even love so many words had come and gone between them that they couldnt easily remember what theyd said what theyd imagined but it didnt matter now they thought they had gotten over something difficult something which had felt immovable the long unbearable ache which had become too much a habit and they were celebrating in their way having dinner at a new expensive place where they had no history of being together where they expected nothing they were sipping wine a deep rich red the waiter was hovering over them like a generous uncle and they were selecting everything he had suggested how good to be in his hands for awhile soon it was happening the old ardor was coming back they were beginning to flirt with one another the way she said baby the way his shoulder was brushing hers the way they were allowing themselves to think for the first time in a long time of the good sex they might later have the after talk which would be easy and low and maybe he hadnt meant what he was about to say maybe when she remarked how she loved the leek soup it was the wine in him his jauntiness that made him ask what else she loved jokingly at first whether she loved the stuffed mushrooms on his plate the braised beef or maybe she loved what others were having this one in the dark suit or that one with the coyly unbuttoned collar or maybe she loved the whole damn menu in fact he couldnt help himself the words came pouring forth spilling all over the table and it was not until late at night when shed finally gone to her room and closed herself off from him in sleep that he stopped talking and remembered only half of what hed said because hed said too much created too much damage crossed some boundary he had avoided most of his life maybe it was desert maybe tundra or the white insinuating madness of the polar ice cap but wherever he was was strange and dangerous and somehow dazzling for all that and only in the morning would he know for better or worse in which direction each of them would be walking it though never had he felt as he had tonight so permissive with himself so luxuriously tactless having said again and again the words he thought he could never bear to use so suddenly commonplace so readily available to him now there is a plasticity to the soul that can fit insidesweaters but not inside drawers how many timescan one watch the

purplehair is clich and i dont like it i let myself get wet in therain today because i wanted you to be proud of me when are mypoems going to stop you this is just the long string of molecules this is just the long the bleached wood massed in bone piles we pulled it from dark beach and built fire in a fenced clearing the posts blunt stubs sank down they circled and were roofed by milled lumber dragged at one time to the coast we slept there each morning the minus tide weeds flowed it like hair swimming the starfish gripped rock pastel rough fish bones lay in sun each noon the milk fog sank from cloud cover came in our clothes and held them tighter on us sea stacks stood and disappeared they came back when the sun scrubbed out the inlet we went down to piles to get mussels i made my shirt a bowl of mussel stones carted them to our grate where they smoked apart i pulled the mussel lip bodies out chewed their squeak we went up the path for fresh water berries hardly speaking thinking during low tide we crossed to the island climbed its wet summit the redfoots and pelicans dropped for fish oclets so silent fell toward water with linked feet jacynthe said little long since we had spoken nova scotia michigan and knew beauty in saying nothing she told me about her mother who would come at them with bread knives then stop herself her face emptied i told her about me never lied at night at times the moon floated we sat with arms tight watching flames spit snap on stone and sand picking up wood shaped like a body like a gull i ran barefoot not only on beach but harsh gravels up through the woods i shit easy covered my dropping some nights no fires we watched sea pucker and get stabbed by the beacon circling on tatoosh i stripped and spread on the sea lip stretched to the slap of the foam and the vast red dulce jacynthe gripped the earth in her fists opened the boil of the tide shuffled into her the beach revolved headlands behind us put their pines in the sun gulls turned a strong sky their pained wings held they bit water quick lifted their looping eyes continually measure the distance from us bare women who do not touch rocks drowsed holes filled with suds from a distance a deep laugh bounced in my flesh and sprayed her flies crawled us jacynthe crawled with her palms she spread my calves she moved my heels from each other a womans mouth is not different sand moved wild beneath me her long hair wiped my legs with women there is sucking the water slops our bodies we come clean our clits beat like twins to the loons rising up we are awake snails sprinkle our gulps fish die in our grips there is sand in the anus of dancing tatoosh island hardens in the distance we see its empty stones sticking out of the sea again jacynthe holds tinder under fire to cook the nights wood if we had men i would make milk in me simply she is quiet i like that you cover your teeth i felt both pleasure and a shiver as we undressed on the slippery bank and then plunged into the wild river i waded in she entered as a diver watching her pale flanks slice the dark i felt both pleasure and a shiver was this a source of the lake we sought giver of itself to that vast blue expanse wed learn by plunging into the wild river and letting the current take us wherever it willed i had that yielding to thank for how i felt both pleasure and a shiver but what she felt and saw ill never know separate bodies taking the same risk by plunging together into the wild river later past the rapids we paused to consider if chance or destiny had brought us here whether it was more than pleasure and a shiver wed found by plunging into the wild river my ghostly fader i me confess first to god and then to you that at a window wot ye how i stale a kosse of gret swetness which don was out avisiness but it is doon not undoon now my ghostly fader i me confess first to god and then to you but i restore it shall doutless agein if so be that i mow and that to god i make a vow and elles i axe foryefness my ghostly fader i me confesse first to god and then to you i no riches from his scanty store my lover could impart he gave a boon i valued more he gave me all his heart ii his soul sincere his generous worth might well this bosom move and when i asked for bliss on earth i only meant his love iii but now for me in search of gain from shore to shore he flies why wander riches to obtain when love is all i prize iv the frugal meal the lowly cot if blest my love with thee that simple fare that humble lot were more than wealth to me v while he the dangerous ocean braves my tears but vainly flow is pity in the faithless waves to which i pour my woe vi the night is dark the waters deep yet soft the billows roll alas at every breeze i weep the storm is in my soul im going to say what love signifies my grandfather said it was the desire of the i for another i and since then i began to search for you my father said the number of love was seven because creation lasted seven days seven days making love to its seven nights i looked for you in each seven that ciphered my life and i found you slipping away to other numbers one confuses oneself with ones other self when two bodies intertwine in bed three loves have been in my life four it will be when you have left five days that i cannot stand you six kisses in la paz centro seven years of not finding you love show me from one to a thousand your nights what is your philosophy of love you ask me in bed and i respond its not a flower but maybe it is a number here i gift it to you hide it between your legs at the count of two make sure that it does not fall one open sesame two loves have stepped into your kingdom translated from the spanish theres a certain sadness to this body of water adjacent to the runway its reeds and weeds handful of ducks the water color manmade a still life and still lifes a cold exercise in looking back back to florida craning my neck like a sandhill crane in alachua basin as for the scrub oaks the hot wind in the leaves was language spanish moss dusky parasitic an obsession i wanted to live in it one professor in exile did covered himself in the stuff as a joke then spent a week removing mites thats enough the fields of rushes lay filled with water and i said farewell my high ship an old red volvo dl gone to another coast another peninsula one without sleep or amphibious music tonight in flight from san francisco because everything is truer at a remove i watch the man i love watch the turn of the sacramento river then sacramento lit city of legislation and flat land i think of florida how flat i think of forgetting florida and then the landscape grows black her red dress hat tease the skys level headed blue outside a country depot she could be a harlot or saint on sunday morning we know hopper could slant light till it falls on our faces she waits for a tall blues singer whose twelve string is hours out of hock for a pullman porter with a pigskin wallet bulging with greenbacks who stepped out of porgy at intermission this is paradise made of pigment tissue where apples ripen into rage lust in a quick glance beyond skincolor shes his muse his wife the same curves to her stance the same breasts beneath summer cloth at the hour the streetlights come on buildings turn abstract the hudson for a moment formal we drink bourbon on the terrace and you speak in the evening voice weighted deep in the throat they plan to harvest oysters you tell me from the harbor by jersey city how the waters will be clean again in twenty years i imagine nets burdened with rough shells the meat dun and sexual below the river and the high rock where boys each year jump from bravado or desperation the day flares turns into itself and innocently sideways the way we always fall into grace or knowledge we watched the police drag the river for a suicide the third this year the terrible hook the boys frail whiteness his face was blank and new as your face in the morning before the day has worked its pattern of lines and tensions a hook like an iron question and this coming out of the waters a flawed pearl a memory that wasnt ours to claim perhaps in a bedroom by lamplight a woman waits for this boy she may riffle drawers gathering photographs string keys to abandoned rooms even now she may be leaving closing the door for some silence i need to move next to you water sluiced from the boys hair i need to watch you light your cigarette the flickering of your face in matchlight as if underwater drifting away i take your cigarette and drag from it touch your hand remember that winter of your long fever the winter we understood how fragile any being together was the wall sweated behind the headboard and you said you felt the rim where dreams crouch and every room of the past it must begin in luxury do you think a break and fall into the glamour attending each kind of surrender water must flood the mind as in certain diseases the walls between the cells of memory dissolve blur into a single stream of voices and faces i dont know any more about this river or if it can be cleaned of its tender and broken histories a tide of voices and this is how the dead rise to us transformed wet and singing the tide of voices pearling in our hands ye old mule that think yourself so fair leave off with craft your beauty to repair for it is true without any fable no man setteth more by riding in your saddle too much travail so do your train appair ye old mulewith false savour though you deceive thair whoso taste you shall well perceive your lairsavoureth somewhat of a kappurs stable ye old muleye must now serve to market and to fair all for the burden for panniers a pair for since gray hairs been powdered in your sable the thing ye seek for you must yourself enableto purchase it by payment and by prayer ye old mule it is not the moon i tell you it is these flowers lighting the yard i hate them i hate them as i hate sex the mans mouth sealing my mouth the mans paralyzing body and the cry that always escapes the low humiliating premise of union in my mind tonight i hear the question and pursuing answer fused in one sound that mounts and mounts and then is split into the old selves the tired antagonisms do you see we were made fools of and the scent of mock orange drifts through the window how can i rest how can i be content when there is still that odor in the world sometimes up out of this land a legend begins to move is it a coming near of something under love love is of the earth only the surface a map of roads leading wherever go miles or little bushes nod not so the legend under fixed inexorable deep as the darkest mine the thick rocks wont tell as fire burns the leaf and out of the green appears the vein in the center line and the legend veins under there so the world happens twice once what we see it as second it legends itself deep the way it is farewell false love the oracle of lies a mortal foe and enemy to rest an envious boy from whom all cares arise a bastard vile a beast with rage possessed a way of error a temple full of treason in all effects contrary unto reason a poisoned serpent covered all with flowers mother of sighs and murderer of repose a sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers as moisture lend to every grief that grows a school of guile a net of deep deceit a gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait a fortress foiled which reason did defend a siren song a fever of the mind a maze wherein affection finds no end a raging cloud that runs before the wind a substance like the shadow of the sun a goal of grief for which the wisest run a quenchless fire a nurse of trembling fear a path that leads to peril and mishap a true retreat of sorrow and despair an idle boy that sleeps in pleasures lap a deep mistrust of that which certain seems a hope of that which reason doubtful deems sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed and for my faith ingratitude i find and sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed whose course was ever contrary to kind false love desire and beauty frail adieu dead is the root whence all these fancies grew when to her lute corinna sings her voice revives the leaden strings and doth in highest notes appear as any challenged echo clear but when she doth of mourning speak evn with her sighs the strings do break and as her lute doth live or die let by her passion so must i for when of pleasure she doth sing my thoughts enjoy a sudden spring but if she doth of sorrow speak evn from my heart the strings do break most of my regrets have to do with water light filtered through shower curtain your skin like yellowed paper i sat on bathroom tiles cold like clammy hands i didnt want to hold and waited for you i didnt think to be embarrassed then neither of us could sleep that night the floorboards creaked and only now do i feel guilty about sneaking into bed with you but that was months ago in a room ill never see again parts of us have begun to die they say that every seven years your body replaces each cell it has ever known soon i will be new again some nights in my dorm room i wake up crying and theres nothing humble about it when moonlight spills across my bed like ilfosol gets caught in my throat like a soreness it isnt because i miss you rather the dark room at my old high school where i used tongs to move your picture from one chemical bath to another in a room ill never see again your face develops right in front of me stop bath by allegra lockstadt the whitning ground in frost is bound the snow is swiftly falling while coldly blows the northern breeze and whistles through the leafless trees in hollow sounds appalling on this cold plain now reachd with pain once stood my fathers dwelling where smiling pleasure once was found now desolation frowns around and wintry blasts are yelling hopes visions wild my thoughts beguild my earliest days delighting till unsuspected treachry came beneath affections specious name the lovely prospect blighting with many a wile of blackest guile did henry first deceive me what winning words to him were givn he swore by all the powrs of heavn that he would never leave me with fondest truth i lovd the youth my soul to guilt a stranger knew not in those too simple hours that oft beneath the sweetest flowrs is couchd the deadliest danger with him to roam i fled my home i burst the bonds of duty i thought my days in joy would roll but henry hid a demons soul beneath an angels beauty shall this poor heart eer cease to smart oh never never never did avrice whisper thee or pride false henry for a wealthier bride to cast me off for ever my sire was poor no golden store had he no earthly treasure i only could his griefs assuage the only pillar of his age his only source of pleasure with anguish wild he missd his child and long in vain he sought her the fiercest thunder bolts of heavn shall on thy guilty head be drivn thou disobedient daughter i feel his fears i see his tears i hear his groans of sadness my cruel falsehood seald his doom he seems to curse me from the tomb and fire my brain to madness oh keenly blow while drifts the snow the cold nocturnal breezes on me the gathring snow flakes rest and colder grows my friendless breast my very heart blood freezes tis midnight deep and thousands sleep unknown to guilt and sorrow they think not of a wretch like me who cannot dare not hope to see the rising light to morrow an outcast hurld from all the world whom none would love or cherish what now remains to end my woes but here amid the deepning snows to lay me down and perish deaths icy dart invades my heart just heavn all good all seeing thy matchless mercy i implore when i must wake to sleep no more in realms of endless being for ten days now two luna moths remain silk winged and lavish as a double broach pinned beneath the porch light of my cabin two of them patinaed that sea glass green of copper weather vanes nosing the wind the sun lit green of rockweed the lichens green scabbing over of the bouldered shore the plush green peat that carpets the island that hushes sinks then holds a boot print for days and the sapling green of new pines sprouting through it the miraculous green origami of their wings false eyed doomed and sensual as the mermaids long green fins a green siren calling from the moonlight a green siren calling from the moonlight from the sweet gum leaves and paper birches that shed like tiny white decrees scrolled bark they emerge from cocoons like greased hinges all pheromone and wing instinct and flutter they rise hardwired driven through the creaking pine branches tufted with beard moss and fog two luna moths flitting like exotic birds towards only each other and light in these their final few days they mate then starving they wait inches apart on my cabin wall to die to share fully each pure and burning moment they are like desire itself born without mouths what if not this is love i came from alabama wid my ban jo on my knee im gwan to louisiana my true love for to see it raind all night the day i left the weather it was dry the sun so hot i frose to death susanna dont you cry oh susanna oh dont you cry for me ive come from alabama wid mi ban jo on my knee i jumped aboard de telegraph and trabbelled down de riber de lectric fluid

mouths im back on my mothers lapwaving my small arms in my seeing there was a blank and he filled that blank with words there were words for darkness which made it lift there were words for cover which ripped them off there were legs that crossed and hearts that crossed promises red and read and the pluck of banjo had a name for that twang and the way he called the world into notice that had a word too once i saw i couldnt unsee and the worst was that the light glaring from the letters left blue haze under my eyelids there are no photographs of this time and i can only go by what others tell me i was blurred and erratic i drew a circle of white chalk around me and called myself inviolate i watched for horses on the horizon my walls were under siege from smaller men who called themselves heroes they say i reached over the balustrade and picked up the tiny ships and threw them over the edge of the world i tore my hair cut one breast from my body and plattered it as around my fortifications one man pulled another man behind his chariot if they say thats how i was thats how i was i have no words for the one in the mirror who apes me every morning shes not the one i remember imagining as a young girl there must be a way to unsee how i tap the glass and she taps back and which wall which cassandra weeping everything i saw i spoke to his ear and the wall crashed into place between us the horse had a bellyful of it the blank was full of small soldiers and he turned from my beauty and said my name because you died i shall not rest again but wander ever through the lone world wide seeking the shadow of a dream grown vain because you died i shall spend brief and idle hours beside the many lesser loves that still remain but find in none my triumph and my pride and disillusions slow corroding stain will creep upon each quest but newly tried for every striving now shall nothing gain because you died might have been certainly these ashes might have been pleasures pilgrims on their way to the holy places remark this place isnt it plain to all that these mounds were palaces this was once a city among men a gathering together of spirit it was measured by the lord and found wanting it was measured by the lord and found wanting destroyd by the angels that inhabit longing surely this is great sodom where such cries as if men were birds flying up from the swamp ring in our ears where such fears that were once desires walk almost spectacular stalking the desolate circles red eyed this place rumord to have been a city surely was separated from us by the hand of the lord the devout have laid out gardens in the desert drawn water from springs where the light was blighted how tenderly they must attend these friendships or all is lost all is lost only the faithful hold this place green only the faithful hold this place green where the crown of fiery thorns descends men that once lusted grow listless a spirit wrappd in a cloud ashes more than ashes fire more than fire ascends only these new friends gather joyous here where the world like great sodom lies under fear the world like great sodom lies under loveand knows not the hand of the lord that moves this the friends teach where such cries as if men were birds fly up from the crowds gatherd and howling in the heat of the sun in the lord whom the friends have named at last love the images and loves of the friends never die this place rumord to have been sodom is blessd in the lords eyes as sweetness flows through these new days the woods leaf out and songbirds phrasein neumes of roosted melodyincipits to a new song then love should find lubricityand quicken having slept so long the bloodroot blossoms well and good but i receive no word that wouldset my troubled heart at ease nor could we turn our faces towardthe sun and open by degrees unless we reach a clear accord and so our love goes night and day its like the thorny hawthorn spraythat whips about in a bitter windfrom dusk to dawn shellacked with sleet until the suns first rays ascendthrough leaves and branches spreading heat i have in mind one april morningwhen she relented without warning relenting from her cold rebuffin laughter peals of happiness sweet christ let me live long enoughto get my hands beneath her dress i hate the elevated talkthat disregards both root and stalkand sets insipid pride abovevicissitudes of lust and strife let others claim a higher love weve got the bread weve got the knife out of your whole life give but one moment all of your life that has gone before all to come after it so you ignore so you make perfect the present condense in a rapture of rage for perfections endowment thought and feeling and soul and sense merged in a moment which gives me at last you around me for once you beneath me above me me sure that despite of time future time past this tick of our life times one moment you love me how long such suspension may linger ah sweet the moment eternal just that and no more when ecstasys utmost we clutch at the core while cheeks burn arms open eyes shut and lips meet some seventy years later your father sitting at your table over wine he savors last rays mellow ing in it recalls his favorite aunt rifka just naming her shoots rifles off again inside the morning square rifles she aimed into the air for certain customers the pigeons erupting handsome clever but with little actual schooling she a jewess kept a shop in moscow stocking horse and battle gear bustling all day long powders braided with his laboring breath still prickle inside his nostrils like the wayward flickers cast by lazily swimming naked limbs leathers polished buckles gleam and the oats banked in their bins heavy august winds drowsed in them at one glance a single sniffing bloom the harnesses and bells by gaslight starred send out appeals while sleighs collect for midnight junkets he smitten with it all like those officers of the czar who admiring her wit her seasoned gaiety forever jammed the shop even the citys metropolitan young despite his full black robes took to dropping in on her his jagged bushy beard awag with chat one balmy summer evening i remember the three of us laughter brimming like wine he turned his glass to the lessened light relaxed in her snug flat the next morning at breakfast talk going on as if wed never stop he a startled look lit on his face breaking in upon himself exclaims the pigeons crackling through the air my god he spent the night with her he sipping the last drop sits back as much as hes amazed amused to see

abandoned the last rig broken the staggeringshadows of trees fence posts gutted cars faces blurred and sienese grave i wish that i could speak only of it all the voices of children singing a chapel in spite of it all by any measure it was endless winter emulsions withthen circled the lake likethis is it this april will beinadequate sensitivity to green i roseearly erased for an hour silk brush and axid like to think im a different person latent image fadingaround the edges and ears overall a tighter facenow is it so hard for you to understandfrom the drop down menuin a cluster of eight poems i selectedsleep but could not i decided to change everythingcomposed entirely of stills or fade into the treesbut could not remember the dreamsave for one brief shotof a woman opening her eyesari pick up im a different personin a perfect world this would be april or an associated conceptgreen to the touch several feet away i want to spend a lot but not all of my years with you well talk about kids but make plans to travel i will remember your eyes as green when they were gray our dogs will be named for now and mostly sex will be good but next doors will sound better there will be small things i will pick up your damp towel from the bed and then i wont i wont be as hot as i was when i wasnt yours and your hairline now so untrustworthy when we pull up alongside a cattle car and hear the frightened lows i will silently judge you for not immediately renouncing meat you will bring me wine and notice how much i drink the garden you plant and i plant is tunneled through by voles the vowels we speak arent vows but theres something holding me here for now like your eyes which i suppose are brown after all tis now since i began to die four months yet still i gasping live wrappd up in sorrow do i lie hoping yet doubting a reprieve adam from paradise expelld just such a wretched being held tis not thy love i fear to lose that will in spite of absence hold but tis the benefit and use is lost as in imprisond gold which though the sum be neer so great enriches nothing but conceit what angry star then governs me that i must feel a double smart prisoner to fate as well as thee kept from thy face linkd to thy heart because my love all love excels must my grief have no parallels sapless and dead as winter here i now remain and all i see copies of my wild state appear but i am their epitome love me no more for i am grown too dead and dull for thee to own immortal heat o let thy greater flame attract the lesser to it let those fires which shall consume the world first make it tame and kindle in our hearts such true desires as may consume our lusts and make thee way then shall our hearts pant thee then shall our brain all her invention on thine altar lay and there in hymns send back thy fire again our eyes shall see thee which before saw dust dust blown by wit till that they both were blind thou shalt recover all thy goods in kind who wert disseized by usurping lust all knees shall bow to thee all wits shall rise and praise him who did make and mend our eyes the other day i was thinking about the term pyramid scheme and why they called it pyramid scheme and not triangle scheme and i asked you what you thought you thought it added a certain gravitas and linked the idea of economic prosperity with some of historys greatest architectural achievements unconsciously suggesting a silent wealth of gold and heat a triangle is two dimensional and therefore a less striking mental image than the idea of a third dimension of financial fraud which is how many dimensions of financial fraud the term pyramid scheme suggests but i had to pause for a second at the financial fraud part because it occurred to me i didnt know what pyramid schemes really were i knew they had something to do with people getting money from nothing like the person at the top of the pyramid scheme or more accurately triangle scheme acquires a number of investors and takes their money and then pays the first lot of investors with the money from another bunch of investors and so on and so forth all the way to the bottom of the triangle or pyramid face which is the kind of stupid thing that happens if you keep your money in a pyramid and not a bank account although if you ask me banks are the real pyramid schemes after all or was love the real pyramid scheme i cant remember maybe its better to keep your money in a pyramid than a bank and i should shop around and compare the interest rates on different pyramids maybe i should open up a savings pyramid with a whole bunch of trapdoors and malarias to keep the financial anthropologists i mean bankers out my emeralds cooling under the ground like beautiful womens eyes i think this was supposed to be a metaphor for something but i cant remember where i was going with it and now its been swept away by the winds of whatever but knowing me it was probably love that great dark blue sex hope that keeps coming true that cartoon black castle with a single bird flying over it i dont know where this poem ends how far below the sand but its still early evening and you and i are a little drunk you answer the phone you pour me a drink i know you hate the domestic in poetry but you should have thought of that before you invited me to move in with you i used to think arguments were the same as honesty i used to think screaming was the same as passion i used to think pain was meaningful i no longer think pain is meaningful i never learned anything good from being unhappy i never learned anything good from being happy either the way i feel about you has nothing to do with learning it has nothing to do with anything but i feel it down in the corners of my sarcophagus i feel it in my sleep even when i am not thinking about you you are still pouring through my blood like fire through an abandoned hospital ward these coins are getting heavy on my eyes it has been a great honor and privilege to love you it has been a great honor and privilege to eat cold pizza on your steps at dawn love is so stupid its like punching the sun and having a million gold coins rain down on you which you dont even have to pay tax on because sun money is free money and im pretty sure there are no laws about that but i would pay tax because i believe that hospitals and education and the arts should be publicly funded even this poem when i look at you my eyes are two identical neighborhood houses on fire when i look at you my eyes bulge out of my skull like a dog in a cartoon when i am with you an enormous silence descends upon me and i feel like i am sinking into the deepest part of my life we walk down the street with the grass blowing back and forth i have never been so happy when the world is reduced to a single dark wood for our two pairs of dazzled eyes to a beach for two faithful children to a musical house for our clear understanding then i shall find you when there is only one old man on earth lonely peaceful handsome living in unsurpassed luxury then i am at your feet when i have realized all your memories when i am the girl who can tie your hands then i will stifle you when we are very strong who draws back or very happy who collapses from ridicule when we are very bad what can they do to us dress up dance laugh i will never be able to throw love out of the window comrade of mine beggar girl monstrous child how little you care about the wretched women and the machinations and my embarrassment join us with your impossible voice oh your voice the one flatterer of this base despair a dark morning in july the taste of ashes in the air the smell of wood sweating in the hearth steeped flowers the devastation of paths drizzle over the canals in the fields why not already playthings and incense i stretched out ropes from spire to spire garlands from window to window golden chains from star to star and i dance the high pond is constantly streaming what witch will rise up against the white sunset what purple flowers are going to descend while public funds disappear in brotherly celebrations a bell of pink are rings in the clouds arousing a pleasant taste of chinese ink a black powder gently rains on my night i lower the jets of the chandelier throw myself on the bed and turning toward thedark i see you o my daughters and queens all that glitters isnt music once hidden in tall grass i tossed fistfuls of dirt into the air doe after doe of leaping you said it was nothing but a trick of the light gold curves gold scarves am i not your animal youd wait in the orchard for hours to watch a deerbreak from the shadows you said it was like lifting a cello out of its black case i like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough atop on the topmost twig which the pluckers forgot somehow forget it not nay but got it not for none could get it till now ii like the wild hyacinth flower which on the hills is found which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound until the purple blossom is trodden in the ground leave me o love which reachest but to dust and thou my mind aspire to higher things grow rich in that which never taketh rust whatever fades but fading pleasure brings draw in thy beams and humble all thy might to that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light that both doth shine and give us sight to see o take fast hold let that light be thy guide in this small course which birth draws out to death and think how evil becometh him to slide who seeketh heavn and comes of heavnly breath then farewell world thy uttermost i see eternal love maintain thy life in me such conundrums of english i blame my ex wife she rearranged my dictionary or re taught an old story in this book if you look for alimony it follows acrimony nothing between however contrition still borders contrivance if it can be seen untruth in her troth sallowed the language sullied a certain conjugation how she lied as she lay with me apparently her monogamy was too close to monotony alas after parting with that particular lass i remain a student examining all our words gradation how anniversary now precedes annihilation if thou survive my well contented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bettering of the time and though they be outstrippd by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought had my friends muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style ill read his for his love new years morning everything is in blossom i feel about average a huge frog and i staring at each other neither of us moves this moth saw brightness in a womans chamber burned to a crisp asked how old he was the boy in the new kimono stretched out all five fingers blossoms at night like people moved by music napped half the day no one punished me fiftieth birthday from now on its all clear profit every sky dont worry spiders i keep house casually these sea slugs they just dont seem japanese hell bright autumn moon pond snails crying in the saucepan after the first course your corsage flatlines into beautiful convulsions it sprouts wings thorns claws its way up your arm to swallow you goosebump by goosebump there is a moment when resurrection devours the most devout heart deep blue the ink pen veins blow up behind my eyes patron saint of stifling anger on the rocks patron saint of politely melting into this tomato soup a spoonful at a time we speak in fortune cookie all night the next dish a ventilator an iv dripping into something already dead i order two specials make the pain remind you of the one who signed your tiny gashes today a struggling creek your tongue wriggles out from the babys breath to ask were we ever anything more than echolocation patron saint of the meteor that falls from the sky forgiven eventually easily i tell her i love her like not killing or ten minutes of sleep beneath the low rooftop wall on which my rifle rests i tell her in a letter that will stink when she opens it of bolt oil and burned powder and the things it says i tell her how pvt bartle says offhand that war is just us making little pieces of metal pass through each other the clouds had made a crimson crown above the mountains high the stormy sun was going down in a stormy sky why did you let your eyes so rest on me and hold your breath between in all the ages this can never be as if it had not been beijing i could still hear the musicians cajoling those thousands of clay horses and horsemen through the squeeze when i woke beside carlotta life size also also terra cotta the sky was still a terra cotta frieze over which her grandfather still held sway with the set square fretsaw stencil plumb line and carpenters pencilhis grandfather brought from roma proud fleshed carlotta hypersarcoma for now our highest ambition was simply to bear the light of the day we had once been planning to seize baginbun the nashville skylines hem and haw as the freebooters who freeboot through their contractual mire and murk like normans stampeding dozens of cows into their norse irish cousins were balking now at this massive breastwork they themselves had thrown up the pile of toot on a mirror the hip hirple of a white horse against purple age old traductions i could trace from freebasers pretending they freebase to this inescapable flaw hidden by carlottas close knit wet suit like a heart wound by a hauberk bannockburn though he was mounted on a cob rather than a warhorse the bruce still managed to sidestep a spear from henry de bohun and tax de bohuns poll with his broad based poleax and leave de bohuns charger somewhat leer her grandfather had yet to find a use for the two timing partisan his grandfather brought man to man against all those ferdinandies until he saw it might come in handy for whacking the thingammybobs off pine and fir off pine and fir and spruce and all such trees as volunteer berwick upon tweed off the elm the ancient pollard that a flemish painter might love that comes to shun the attention of its headstrong days so is proof against the storm that takes its neighbors roof her nonno collects his pension knowing that when push really came to shove he had it within him to wrap his legs in puttees and backslap those pack mules down that moonlit deck carlotta now wearing a halter neck under the long sleeved high collared wet suit whereof whereof whereof whereof i needs must again make mention blaye her wet suit like a coat of mail worn by a french knight from the time a knight could still cause a ruction by direct charging his rouncy when an englishmans home was his bouncy castle when abduction and seduction went hand in glove now carlotta would climb from the hotel pool in nashville take off her mask and set a spill to a gauloise as one might set a spill to the fuse of a falconet and the walls of her chest assail the french meanwhile were still struggling to prime their weapons of mass destruction bosworth field it was clear now through the pell mell of bombard and basilisk mist that the stanleys had done the dirt on him and taken henrys side now richards very blood seemed to have shied away from him seemed to sputter and spurt like a falcon sheering off from his wrist as he tried to distance himself from the same falchioneer whod pelf the crown from his blood matted brow and hang it in a tree less clear was how hed managed not to crack the shell of the pigeon egg the size of a cyst hed held so close inside his shirt blackwater fort as i had held carlotta close that night we watched some xenophon embedded with the th marines in the old sunni triangle make a half assed attempt to untangle the ghastly from the price of gasoline there was a distant fanfaron in the nashville sky where the wind had now drawn itself up and pinned on her breast a texaco star why carlotta wondered the house of tar might it have to do with the gross imports of crude oil bush will come clean on only when the tigris comes clean benburb those impromptu chevaux de frise into which they galloped full tilt and impaled themselves have all but thrown off their balance the banner bearing scots determined to put manners on the beech mast and cress and hazelnut eating irish however jerry built those chevaux de frise have embogged the horses whose manes they had hogged so lovingly and decked with knots of heather horses rooted to the spots on which they go down on their knees as they unwind their shoulder plaids and kilts the checkered careers of their guts boyne the blood slick from the horse slaughter i could no longer disregard as carlotta surfaced like barm my putting her through her paces as she kicked and kicked against the traces like a pack mule kicking from a yardarm before it fell heehaw in the dockyard a banners frittering tassel or deflating bouncy castle was something to which she paid heed whereas that vision of a milk white steed drinking from a tub of water and breathing hard breathing a little hard had barely set off an alarm blenheim small birds were sounding the alert as i followed her unladen steed through a dell so dark and dank she might have sported the waders her grandfather had worn at the nadir of his career scouring the outer banks for mummichog and menhaden those weeks and months in the doldrums coming back as he ran his thumb along an old venetian blind in the hope that something might come to mind that he might yet animadvert the maiden name of that iron maiden on which he was drawing a blank bunker hill carlotta took me in her arms as a campfire gathers a branch to itself her mouth a cauter set to my bleeding bough heehaw her grandfather sterilizing his saw in a tub of proof firewater a helper standing by to stanch the bleeding in some afterlife no looking daggers at the knife shed meet the breast high parapet with the nonchalance the no fucking sweat of a slightly skanky schoolmarm though the surgeon was preparing to ganch her like whats his faces daughter brandywine i crouched in my own little ease by the pool at the vanderbilt where carlotta crouched sputter sput just as she had in the scanner when the nurse keen sighted as a lanner picked out a tumor like a rabbit scut on dark ground it was as if a fine silt white sand or silicate had clogged her snorkel her goggles had fogged and carlotta surfaced like flot to be skimmed off some great cast iron pot as garble is skimmed off or lees painstakingly drained by turnings and tilts from a man size barrel or butt badli ke seraipork barrels pork butts the wide screen surround sound of a massed attack upon the thin red cellulose by those dust or fust or must cells that cause the tears to well and well and well at which i see him turning up his nose as if hed bitten on a powder pack like yet another sad sepoy who wont fall for the british ploy of greasing with ham the hammer or smoothing over carlottas grammar on which on which bush will come clean her grandfather a man who sees no lack of manhood in the lachrymose bull run while some think theres nothing more rank than the pool thats long stood aloof from the freshet i loved the smell of sweat and blood and s horse dung carlotta shouldered like an aqua lung as she led me now through that dewy dell and spread her house of tartan waterproof as we lay there i could have sworn as i stared through unruffled thorns that were an almost perfect fit to each side of the gravel pit where she and id tried to outflank each other i traced the mark of a hoof or horseshoe in her fontanelle bronkhorstspruit i traced the age old traduction of a stream through a thorn thicket as a gush from a farthingale skeffingtons daughter skeffington attention shun attention shun shun shun we lay in a siding between two rails and watched an old white horse cross

mouthfuls of my never to be digested face my immovable femur caught in your throat like a fish bone let my body be what could never leave your body when the motorboat man asked me to love him i whispered precipice the word for the no more boyfriend feeling because precipice contains ice practically twice because i wanted teetering what he saidyes his ears from the engines so hard of hearing his hands always so hot mid our first winter id clung so long to the dock he had to crowbar my fingers off each digit cracked so cleanly would you say they break like icicles i asked sweetly i knew i was nothing but if i could sustain one song i is i is i is i is i is i could be ice sex on the bathrooms cold marble counter was best i whispered statuette monument what he sculpting my legs said yes the child i named her cecily it sounded like iced lily for pure i said pristine at the ocean i said brine isle for vacation for flowers edelweiss but when i said only of late late i choose ice brittle pearls broke behind my syllables did he hear me again twice thrice for my love we would need to live in a great pyramid we would need to sleep beneath the continental shelf with antarctic crust blanketing us the only driveway to any kind of house is an iceberg ridden northwest passage when i whispered universe you were to translate it asone bright lineone bright rime your soul is like a landscape fantasy where masks and bergamasks in charming wise strum lutes and dance just a bit sad to be hidden beneath their fanciful disguise singing in minor mode of lifes largesse and all victorious love they yet seem quite reluctant to believe their happiness and their song mingles with the pale moonlight the calm pale moonlight whose sad beauty beaming sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees and makes the marbled fountains gushing streaming slender jet fountains sob their ecstasies i came close to his wet dogs eye a fat tear shared animal pain sloshed seeped in between us darling im sorry you were born a dog people notice it come on in weve been expecting you like a clue we found people in the kitchen in the suicide vest with the kalashnikov such beautiful desperate weapons their faces had to be covered so we didnt fall in love piteously with the self same wretchedness we see in mirrors a worryingly familiar scene weve lived in will live in the carnage going on behind closed doors being told regurgitatingly you only get one shot but is it true you only get one shot when you get a loaded magazine plenty more where that came from in the munitions depot which i picture in arizona right beside a render farm and to the left the cloud that backs up and up and up up to where are there edges bobby intelligence tells us to test the power of names by naming things for one thing to name is to guarantee the end like a starting pistol bang you name it its smithereens i am so indifferent to the limits of feelings i cant tell the difference every time someone lifts my flap the unwashed salad the unheated leftovers the sanitary products are standard but bear no relation to what i expected to feel overlaid with various forms of filth dont you sometimes feel like getting wrapped in a dog towel and buried in the hardening ground under the canadian maple do dogs need to approach death and back away from it like i did when the vet injected deep pentobarbital his bowels ejected across the floor tiles i was there to inhale his fur and weep for my benefit i am not independent of my feelings this way of talking about feelings has fooled each one of us id rather be given cbt by a border collie when there are fewer words around my arms around his only adored and stinking neck dead up my nostrils throw me in there with him everything is in the cold awful and im not ok and without good reason still here and feelings just a gentle reminder a lot of work goes into making sex alluring sex is just this and that but it seemed for a moment that a new climax had been won when even the sky fingered me with a slobbery insistence when we were retching with so much desire we created a whole new atmosphere grabbing at sex things using the sick bag to be actually sick in now the shower curtain is transparent its a way of saying i want you too to have this experience so that we are more alike like a sign that life struck once in a slippy bits marathon that began when our eyes were magnets yanked to each others fully charged crotches at a picnic when it was essential to make every enhancement to our connection by getting seriously indecent beside the bluetooth wireless speaker system until even the trees had to dash inside to pour ice in their underpants while i choked up playing the scene as we lived it united by our pursuit of arrhythmia or satisfying itches to that catchy bridge section in chopin i couldnt wait to come with chopin through his melancholic meadow not that i approve of background music i prefer to foreground the piano by massaging it loud and all over until the top layer comes off in my hand and the pedal squeaks for humanity i like to feel a piano as an instrument of interruption and consciousness though i also like to take light swims to get away from what i feel today i felt jelly beans resemble kidneys which throbs like everyone grieving here have a new puppy said the russians to the french to soften the dog loss but mostly the dogs image the image is the greater likeness except we never seem to run out of images sometimes something in an image runs through me and that is very common as is reading about something thats happening to someone outside of me until i know someone outside of me without any knowledge it is a test for my knowledge to hang around until morning practically all mornings are news to me practically all knowledge is news to me practically all news is images going very fast around the world so we have to guzzle them like wrapped food hot and on the run in one end and squitted out the other pics or it didnt happen until im fat with implications and containing not a sausage i love a good weepy dog meme as much as the next crybaby and nauseate irregularly when the gifs load automatically his hairy body into my hairy body unfairly the dog becomes the shape of p m in me on a tuesday if we accept the world as totally fucked theres a lot worse coming than dog hairs in macaroni cheese dog hairs on pillows dog hairs in rented flats in bathtubs in my hair in my dogs hair in your short curlies between my teeth in coagulant soap bars some people are revolted by dogs and dogs are not up for revolting i am revolted when dogs are lacking what if he did lick my cheeks by which i mean buttocks which were coated in whipped shea butter and heavily comestible its obvious hes related to a father he never knew because we found all his needs and perverted them into a kind of inter species loyalty or the usual master slave hierarchy before laying down the crisp breakfast bowl of the rest of his days which gave us carte blanche to rush in anytime and smother him with kisses without getting socked in the eye unlike when i tried the same on johnny who spat my tongue out no one blamed him when maybe all he wants is just to go on being less and less subtle and alive the way life becomes very well known after its termination if rigor mortis sets in it means theres somebody who needs it it means that somebody is drained and not awake and deems any speckles of life unusable and he is dead and dead all dead in the humus of trashed bodies shoved down there dressed in made up relationships whats your favorite part mines every part with a maggot in it maggots mean that lifes still leaking its like magic when his dead voice is nauseating and i cant see him so he might as well be invisible its like magic when he isnt and doesnt have anything to say and i cant bear to listen anyway so i just recognize my fingers all the injuries theyve inflicted while my skin drops off whats worse than a maggot in the eat me glove box dates does the second rule apply to something that drops dead is it true he might come back and crack open a pi ata blue alcopops bombay mix karaoke and a pint of nostalgia which is like thinking in another language i mean how it feels not what it means half a maggot the memory of mange marching across his fur describes a lot of other feelings the feeling that someone else is taking up the whole room the feeling that no one could help me now or ever whether i was on several edges my hot core and noggin facing this hammering world of brainlessness and sweetbreads was always a favorite word i dont know what it tastes like but i know its terrible a ldskjfa lkdgjsa meaning im so overcharged that all i can do is literally slam my hands head breasts against the keyboard wherever there are corpses there are maggots if we dig him up will he be wearing a jacket look out for the milkier gentler solaces which for all we know for all we know could be the wind or chopins noise still hammering the background whos seen it only its aftermath is visible whats not visible is the aftermath of my screaming you can catch me on the floor dog syringe periphery of the dying and dead scene face female maybe my whole life carting sensations to the center mopping shit up with towels skull coffin there are feelings for these things while public petting car plane rocket bodies leak its no surprise what i give away one droplet you can have when the vet twirls off to deal with some bloody business in a kitchen knife gun the hug a corpse scene gets deep in the hold of what i am party popper wastebin is what ive not yet been who concocts the smell of dogs which smells like an extreme close up of the world oozing in at the edges full as an ice cube is full of liquid i mistook it for solidity the world is too full of smells though its impossible to see the top of it they crawl between my legs in the shimmering fuzz on top of the plant stickers of evenings tongues held out pocket friendly air fresheners strikes on our nostrils they come at me streaming why the dog why not the dog was it only a dream of soil heating held and stimulated for his unique aroma its not a way in but it places you somewhere that smells strong and looks strong leaving behind us hi music lives inside my legs its coming out when i talk im going to send my valentines to people you dont even know oatmeal cookies make my throat gallop grown ups keep their feet on the ground when they swing i hate that look at those os with a smash in the middle that spells good bye dont ever say purpose again lets throw the word out dont talk big to me im carrying my box of faces if i want to change faces i will yesterday faded but tomorrows in boldface when i grow up my old names will live in the house where we live now ill come and visit them only one of my eyes is tired the other eye and my body arent is it true all metal was liquid first does that mean if we bought our car earlier they could have served it in a cup theres a stopper in my arm thats not going to let me grow any bigger ill be like this always small and i will be deep water too wait just wait how deep is the river would it cover the tallest man with his hands in the air your head is a souvenir when you were in new york i could see you in real life walking in my mind ill invite a bee to live in your shoe what if you found your shoe full of honey what if the clock said instead of would you be scared my tongue is the car wash for the spoon can noodles swim my toes are dictionaries do you need any words from now on ill only drink white milk on january what does minus mean i never want to minus you just think no one has ever seen inside this peanut before it is hard being a person i do and dont love you isnt that happiness i do not know where either of us can turn just at first waking from the sleep of each other i do not know how we can bear the river struck by the gold plummet of the moon or many trees shaken together in the darkness we shall wish not to be alone and that love were not dispersed and set free though you defeat me and i be heavy upon you but like earth heaped over the heart is love grown perfect like a shell over the beat of life is love perfect to the last so let it be the same whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another let us know this for leavetaking that i may not be heavy upon you that you may blind me no more if i had known two years ago how drear this life should be and crowd upon itself allstrangely sad mayhap another song would burst from out my lips overflowing with the happiness of future hopes mayhap another throb than that of joy have stirred my soul into its inmost depths if i had known if i had known two years ago the impotence of love the vainness of a kiss how barren a caress mayhap my soul to higher things have soarn nor clung to earthly loves and tender dreams but ever up aloft into the blue empyrean and there to master all the world of mind if i had known let us go then you and i when the evening is spread out against the sky like a patient etherized upon a table let us go through certain half deserted streets the muttering retreats of restless nights in one night cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster shells streets that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent to lead you to an overwhelming question oh do not ask what is it let us go and make our visit in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window panes licked its tongue into the corners of the evening lingered upon the pools that stand in drains let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys slipped by the terrace made a sudden leap and seeing that it was a soft october night curled once about the house and fell asleep and indeed there will be time for the yellow smoke that slides along the street rubbing its back upon the window panes there will be time there will be time to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet there will be time to murder and create and time for all the works and days of hands that lift and drop a question on your plate time for you and time for me and time yet for a hundred indecisions and for a hundred visions and revisions before the taking of a toast and tea in the room the women come and go talking of michelangelo and indeed there will be time to wonder do i dare and do i dare time to turn back and descend the stair with a bald spot in the middle of my hair they will say how his hair is growing thin my morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin my necktie rich and modest but asserted by a simple pin they will say but how his arms and legs are thin do i dare disturb the universe in a minute there is time for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse for i have known them all already known them all have known the evenings mornings afternoons i have measured out my life with coffee spoons i know the voices dying with a dying fall beneath the music from a farther room so how should i presume and i have known the eyes already known them all the eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase and when i am formulated sprawling on a pin when i am pinned and wriggling on the wall then how should i begin to spit out all the butt ends of my days and ways and how should i presume and i have known the arms already known them all arms that are braceleted and white and bare but in the lamplight downed with light brown hair is it perfume from a dress that makes me so digress arms that lie along a table or wrap about a shawl and should i then presume and how should i begin shall i say i have gone at dusk through narrow streets and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes of lonely men in shirt sleeves leaning out of windows i should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas and the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully smoothed by long fingers asleep tired or it malingers stretched on the floor here beside you and me should i after tea and cakes and ices have the strength to force the moment to its crisis but though i have wept and fasted wept and prayed though i have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter i am no prophet and heres no great matter i have seen the moment of my greatness flicker and i have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snicker and in short i was afraid and would it have been worth it after all after the cups the marmalade the tea among the porcelain among some talk of you and me would it have been worth while to have bitten off the matter with a smile to have squeezed the universe into a ball to roll it towards some overwhelming question to say i am lazarus come from the dead come back to tell you all i shall tell you all if one settling a pillow by her head should say that is not what i meant at all that is not it at all and would it have been worth it after all would it have been worth while after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets after the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the floor and this and so much more it is impossible to say just what i mean but as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen would it have been worth while if one settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl and turning toward the window should say that is not it at all that is not what i meant at all no i am not prince hamlet nor was meant to be am an attendant lord one that will do to swell a progress start a scene or two advise the prince no doubt an easy tool deferential glad to be of use politic cautious and meticulous full of high sentence but a bit obtuse at times indeed almost ridiculous almost at times the fool i grow old i grow old i shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled shall i part my hair behind do i dare to eat a peach i shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach i have heard the mermaids singing each to each i do not think that they will sing to me i have seen them riding seaward on the waves combing the white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and black we have lingered in the chambers of the sea by sea girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown till human voices wake us and we drown the curious wits seeing dull pensiveness bewray itself in my long settld eyes whence those same fumes of melancholy rise with idle pains and missing aim do guess some that know how my spring i did address deem that my muse some fruit of knowledge plies others because the prince my service tries think that i think state errors to redress but harder judges judge ambitions ragei scourge of itself still climbing slippry placei holds my young brain captivd in golden cage o fool or over wise alas the race of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start but only stellas eyes and stellas heart when i go away from you the world beats dead like a slackened drum i call out for you against the jutted stars and shout into the ridges of the wind streets coming fast one after the other wedge you away from me and the lamps of the city prick my eyes so that i can no longer see your face why should i leave you to wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night in green water i saw your eye and in it i saw that arabian palace filled with birds and broken glass i copy an address into my right hand and fill myself with memories of psalms a green fish emerges from seaweed as seaweed from a wave that rises like the wailing wall my sun baked body at the edge wind in my lungs its whistle my torn world my grief my soggy passport my shell with no pearl you lift them delicate cloud into a liquid world last night i dreamed of my fathers flabby body and of my blue resolve to run away to find a way i dreamed of your eye and for an instant i found the vertex of the road the imaginary line that falls across the earth that meridian where the sun on a tigers back meets the shade at its belly waking up we are swallowed by wakefulness the house swallows us in its terrible thirst the routine of taking our children to school swallows us and so does the if only i could there was something to that dream you know it a direction a way a forest as green as you and your roots give me your premonitions give me your book give me your prodigious memory give me the blue gaze from your dark eye give me the devotion of your sleeping birds sometimes the way is a fire through which the circus tiger leaps a perfect circle returning to me with its stripes intact and with the endless continuity of this ineluctably feral world the belt kicks on with a whir the whirlicks the end grain of the offcut with a hintof hesitation a small wind of ochre dustsweeps off the belt before the belt comes backto where it was the whole room swellswith the scent of cinnamon desire how imprecise the smell of desire the wood takes on a sheen a glossthe grain can live behind without worryof being forgotten a single knot blinksout of the small block and becomesthe eye of a hummingbird its beakbending around the edge of the wood its small song captured in the annular rings to think this block was tossed inwith the scraps that the birdcould have been lost or burned i loved a girl when i was a girl before i knew desire could be used against me i so wanted to be relevant simple exchange bouquets of wheat my dirt stained hands tangled hair i never could be prim in apple pie order i dropped all the eggs licking their smear off my hands wrinkled her ribbons into my pocket tore pages from her books all for the sake of the lonely hour in a strange house a strange bed in a strange town a very strange me is waiting for you now it is very early in the morning the silence is loud the baby is walking about with his foaming bottle making strange sounds and deciding after all to be my friend you arrive tonight how dull time is how empty and yet since i am sitting here lying here walking up and down here waiting i see that times cruel ability to make one wait is times reality i see your hair which i call red i lie here in this bed someone teased me once a friend of ours saying that i saw your hair red because i was not thinking of the hair on your head someone also told me a long time ago my father said to me it is a terrible thing son to fall into the hands of the living god now i know what he was saying i could not have seen red before finding myself in this strange this waiting bed nor had my naked eye suggested that colour was created by the light falling now on me in this strange bed waiting where no one has ever rested the streets i observe are wintry it feels like snow starlings circle in the sky conspiring together and alone unspeakable journeys into and out of the light i know i will see you tonight and snow may fall enough to freeze our tongues and scald our eyes we may never be found again just as the birds above our heads circling are singing knowing that in what lies before them the always unknown passage wind water air the failing light the failing night the blinding sun they must get the journey done listen they have wings and voices are making choices are using what they have they are aware that on long journeys each bears the other whirring stirring love occuring in the middle of the terrifying air ametas thinkst thou that this love can stand whilst thou still dost say me nay love unpaid does soon disband love binds love as hay binds hay thestylis thinkst thou that this rope would twine if we both should turn one way where both parties so combine neither love will twist nor hay ametas thus you vain excuses find which yourselves and us delay and love ties a womans mind looser than with ropes of hay thestylis what you cannot constant hope must be taken as you may ametas then lets both lay by our rope and go kiss within the hay i never thought id keep a record of my pain or happiness like candles lighting the entire soft lace of the air around the full length of your hair a shower organized by god in brown and auburn undulations luminous like particles of flame but now i do retrieve an afternoon of apricots and water interspersed with cigarettes and sand and rocks we walked across how easily you held my hand beside the low tide of the world now i do relive an evening of retreat a bridge i left behind where all the solid heat of lust and tender trembling lay as cruel and as kind as passion spins its infinite tergiversations in between the bitter and the sweet alone and longing for you now i do you charmd me not with that fair face though it was all divine to be anothers is the grace that makes me wish you mine the gods and fortune take their part who like young monarchs fight and boldly dare invade that heart which is anothers right first mad with hope we undertake to pull up every bar but once possessd we faintly make a dull defensive war now every friend is turnd a foe in hope to get our store and passion makes us cowards grow which made us brave before never prophesy you cant so dont try lust pride and lethargymay cause us miseryor bliss the meanest mistakehas a point to make hear this what his vintner deyquem saidonce the lord deyquem was dead the wine that year promised bad or none hed let it go too late rot had crawled through all the vines greasy scum on every cluster dangling at the crotches of the leaves should have been long picked but hed said no wait for me off to wait on a new woman grapes on the verge of ripe when he left coupling kept him till rot wrapped the grapes like lace by the time shed kicked him out the sun had got them they hung shriveled in the blast well he rode home cocky bullied the grapes into the vats rot all spoiled grapes too old too soon squeezed dry the wine makes the wine makes thick gold colored pours like honey we try it fantastic not like honey punchy youve never drunk anything like it refreshing in a rush over a heat that slows your throat wanting to keep that flavor stuck to the edge of your tongue where your taste is keep it like the best bouquet you can remember of sundown summer someone coming to you smiling the taste has odor like a new country so fine at first you cant take it in its so strange its beautiful believe me you love to go slow moral age is notall dry rot its never too late sweet is your real estate three people drinking out of the bottle in the living room a cold rain quiet as a mirror one of the men stuffs his handkerchief in his coat climbs the stairs with the girl the other man is left sitting at the desk with the wine and the headache turning an old ellington side over in his mind and over he held her like a saxophone when she was his girl her tongue trembling at the reed the man lying next to her now thinks of another woman her white breath idling before he drove off he said something about a spell watching the snow fall on her shoulders the musician crawls back into his horn ancient terrapin at the approach of the wheel after the trumpets after the incense there were nights insomnia fathered gods i then rejected as too angry or distracted or whose appetite for submission revealed their own lack of faith say our names all synonyms for trust others spoke in sugared paradox to know is to know all to not know all is not to know to know all requires that you know very little but to know that little you have to know all and for a while its true i burned in the dark fires of ambivalence my attention consumed like oxygen id wake up tired as i had with the married man whose strictures and caprice begat and begat and begat and begat my love for him harvesting the same silence from my bed who listens to my penitential tune who accepts my petitions for convenient parking for spring for the self illuminated across a kitchen table for for fortitude ive heard a voice im sure advising me to drop this sentimental farce only to hold the smoke of their names again in my mouth id resurrect the dead or adopt the gods orphaned by atheists except the gods theyve made from disbelief no ones faith could tolerate refusing to make the same mistake just once ive cried out to the dark many names most given up as routinely as the secrets of friends if youre a cup will my lips profane your own if a comb will i feel your teeth against my neck if a wall i will be darker than your shadow and if a door i will unlatch you letting in all the little foxes from the vineyard beloved my beloved when i think that thou wast in the world a year ago what time i sate alone here in the snow and saw no footprint heard the silence sink no moment at thy voice but link by link went counting all my chains as if that so they never could fall off at any blow struck by thy possible hand why thus i drink of lifes great cup of wonder wonderful never to feel thee thrill the day or night with personal act or speech nor ever cull some prescience of thee with the blossoms white thou sawest growing atheists are as dull who cannot guess gods presence out of sight it was way back before there was a way back when time threaded earth and sky children were conceived were born grew and walked tall in what we now call a day there must have been two suns a bright moon somehow we had more light than now sheen of falling in love playing about earths body in a wild flicker which lit us up we who were this planet and yearned for touch every planted thought grew plant ladders to the stars way back before there was no way back miss mary mack we used to sing along the buttons of her dress our babies are always our babies even back then when time waved through the corn we knew our plants like relatives their stories were our stories there were songs for everything i should say are songs for every transformation they link between way back and now the forever now a time when a young mvskoke man and woman walked through the shimmer of the early evening they had become as one song they lay down when it was dark i can hear their intimate low voice talking how they tease one another with such gut love earth makes a bed with pillow mounds and it is there as the night insects sing they conceived their first child they will look back as they walk east toward the sunrise the raw stalks of beginning will drink the light root deeply dark into earth in the tracks of their loving the plant child emerges first the seed head then leafy long male body and the white female flowers of tobacco orhece as the people called it when it called to them come here we were brought to you from those who love you we will help you and thats how it began way back when we knew how to hear the songs of plants and could sing back like now on paper with marks like bird feet but where are our ears they have grown to fit around earbuds to hear music made for cold cash like our beloved smoke making threaded with addiction and dead words sing this song back to me girl in the moonlight tobacco plant had silver moon buttons all up her back were getting dressed to go plant new songs with words our sun is dimming faster mvto hece mvto hvse mvto e kanvchaga mvto ah these poems these poems these poems she said are poems with no love in them these are the poems of a man who would leave his wife and child because they made noise in his study these are the poems of a man who would murder his mother to claim the inheritance these are the poems of a man like plato she said meaning something i did not comprehend but which nevertheless offended me these are the poems of a man who would rather sleep with himself than with women she said these are the poems of a man with eyes like a drawknife with hands like a pickpockets hands woven of water and logic and hunger with no strand of love in them these poems are as heartless as birdsong as unmeant as elm leaves which if they love love only the wide blue sky and the air and the idea of elm leaves self love is an ending she said and not a beginning love means love of the thing sung not of the song or the singing these poems she said you are he said beautiful that is not love she said rightly the dog licks my hand as i worry about the left nipple of the woman in the bathroom she is drying her hair the woman whose left nipple is sore we looked this evening for diagonal cuts or discoloration or bite marks from small insects that may be in our bed it is a good bed a faithful bed a bed that wont be hurt by the consideration we gave to the possibility of small though disproportionately strong insects in our bed the blow dryer sounds like a jet taking off the first time i flew to brussels people began the journey happy but ended with drool on their shirts she is drying her hair though she has never been to brussels drying her hair though she could be petting a dog drying her hair while having red thoughts about what the pain in her nipple means i would not dry my hair in such a moment but i am bald the body of the woman has many ways to cease being the body of the woman i have one way to be happy and she is that way i would like to fly with her to brussels we would not be put off by the drool this is what happens when people sleep we would buy postcards of the little boy who saved brussels when he peed on a fire we would be romantic in public places for the moment these desires can best be furthered by petting a dog im also working on this theory that sometimes a part of the body just hurts that the purpose of prayer is to make the part of the body that sometimes just hurts the little toe or appendix something vestigial or redundant something that can be jettisoned i have no reason to use the word cancer while petting a dog here is a piece of a second during which a jet is not flying nor is it on the ground im working on a theory that no one can die inside that piece of a second if you are comforted by this thought you are welcome to keep it today when persimmons ripen today when fox kits come out of their den into snow today when the spotted egg releases its wren song today when the maple sets down its red leaves today when windows keep their promise to open today when fire keeps its promise to warm today when someone you love has died or someone you never met has died today when someone you love has been born or someone you will not meet has been born today when rain leaps to the waiting of roots in their dryness today when starlight bends to the roofs of the hungry and tired today when someone sits long inside his last sorrow today when someone steps into the heat of her first embrace today let this light bless you with these friends let it bless you with snow scent and lavender bless you let the vow of this day keep itself wildly and wholly spoken and silent surprise you inside your ears sleeping and waking unfold itself inside your eyes let its fierceness and tenderness hold you let its vastness be undisguised in all your days little patches of grass disappear in the jaws of lusty squirrels who slip into the spruce cars collapse into parts spring dissolves into summer the kitten into the cat a tray of drinks departs from the buffet and voil the partys over all thats left are some pickles and a sprig of wilting parsley on the rug when i think of all those gong tormented mesozoic seas i feel a ripple of extinction and blow a smoke ring through the trees soon there will be nothing left here but sky when i think about the fact i am not thinking about you it is a new way of thinking about you loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show that she dear she might take some pleasure of my pain pleasure might cause her read reading might make her know knowledge might pity win and pity grace obtain i sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe studying inventions fine her wits to entertain oft turning others leaves to see if thence would flow some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain but words came halting forth wanting inventions stay invention natures child fled step dame studys blows and others feet still seemed but strangers in my way thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes biting my truant pen beating myself for spite fool said my muse to me look in thy heart and write fayre is my love when her fayre golden heares with the loose wynd ye waving chance to marke fayre when the rose in her red cheekes appears or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke fayre when her brest lyke a rich laden barke with pretious merchandize she forth doth lay fayre when that cloud of pryde which oft doth dark her goodly light with smiles she drives away but fayrest she when so she doth display the gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight throgh which her words so wise do make their way to beare the message of her gentle spright the rest be works of natures wonderment but this the worke of harts astonishment its right before you drive away our limbs still warm with sleep coffee sputtering out the north wind your hips pressing me hard against the

field oranges in a bowl garlic radio in the story of us no one wins isolation is a new theme someone says by now ive invented you most people dont like to touch dead things thats what my friend tells me when i find my fish on the floor it must have wanted an out sometimes my desire scares me sometimes i watch football and think four chances is enough to get there but we dont have helmets i want to say harder i can take it but theres no proof i can i lovd thee from the earliest dawn when first i saw thy beautys ray and will until lifes eve comes on and beautys blossom fades away and when all things go well with thee with smiles and tears remember me ill love thee when thy morn is past and wheedling gallantry is oer when youth is lost in ages blast and beauty can ascend no more and when lifes journey ends with thee o then look back and think of me ill love thee with a smile or frown mid sorrows gloom or pleasures light and when the chain of life runs down pursue thy last eternal flight when thou hast spread thy wing to flee still still a moment wait for me ill love thee for those sparkling eyes to which my fondness was betrayd bearing the tincture of the skies to glow when other beauties fade and when they sink too low to see reflect an azure beam on me left a hole on fire agony or was it the sun on the banks and near duets eagles with the white wine of the sun clink and spill tall grass over head and heels space of hell shy inscribed already but alone i think i can be that again a new hole in the ongoing flute in a leap the country glows to hone the fate that

fountain lips a promise that a wish will purge or pennies caravan the safe return hearts cross an hour inland from bangor maine over rolling hills in an oval pasture surrounded by giant conifers the forest floor bejeweled with ruby studded mushrooms i watch the sheep sing if bleating could be called a song maybe someone in a grove long ago saw a man attached to a beast of burden and so the concept of the satyr was born memory is the past reversed i once went out with a sailor a spaniard from andaluc a we met at sea where i worked the roulette wheel in the ships casino his legs were slightly bowed his voice gruff and torn and when he came the sound seemed to climb up not from his throat but from his feet smelling of earth and sea and grief a deep song lorca called duende it wasnt pretty his blue and red and purple briefs soaking in a bucket by the cabin door he told me once when he was a boy his grandmother had caught him trying to fuck a chicken the poor chicken he laughed his saddle worn andaluc an laugh feathers flying everywhere his grandmother screaming and what to call those half human half chicken kinds of days scratching and clawing at the earth bathed in dust trying not to think about the simmering anise peppercorn and broth when i visited him he met me at the airport then the long train ride south through field after field of sunflowers por la tarde

place my ring on your cock where it belongs no horsemen bearing terror no soldiers of doom will swoop in and sweep us apart theyre too busy looting the land to watch us they dont know we need each other critically they expect us to call in sick watch television all night die by our own hands they dont know we are becoming powerful every time we kiss we confirm the new world coming what the rose whispers before blooming i vow to you i give you my heart a safe house i give you promises other than milk honey liberty i assume you will always be a free man with a dream in america place your ring on my cock where it belongs long may we live to free this dream first time he kissed me he but only kissed the fingers of this hand wherewith i write and ever since it grew more clean and white slow to world greetings quick with its oh list when the angels speak a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss the second passed in height the first and sought the forehead and half missed half falling on the hair o beyond meed that was the chrism of love which loves own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own ill choose for myself next time who ill reach out and take as mine in the way i might stand at a fruit stall having decided to ignore the apples the mangoes and the kiwis but hold my hands above a pile of oranges as if to warm my skin before a fire not only have i chosen oranges but ill also choose which orange ill test a few for firmness scrape some rind off with my fingernail so that a citrus scent will linger there all day i wont be happy with the first one i pick but will try different ones until i know you how will i know you youll feel warm between my palms and ill cup you like a handful of holy water a vision will come to me of your exotic land the sun you swelled under the tree you grew from a drift of white blossoms from the orange tree will settle in my hair and ill know this is how i will choose you by feeling you smelling you by slipping you into my coat maybe then ill climb the hill look down on the town we live in with sunlight on my face and a miniature sun burning a hole in my pocket thirsty ill suck the juice from it from you when i walk away ill leave behind a trail of lamp bright rind how solitary and resolute you look in the morning a stoic in your cotton sleeve do you dream of walking out rain or shine a truffle balanced on your sternum and passing me on the sidewalk or is that a smile because you interpret nothing and statelessness is where you live how calmly you indulge my moods see you tonight by the sovereign chartreuse ceramics at the met lets hear what youd

inside me sideways as always in the morning you ask me to be on top of you then we take a nap were late for school you arrive at night inspired and drunk there is no reason for our clothes we take a bath and lie down facing each other then later we turn over finally you come we face each other and talk about childhood as soon as i touch your penis i wind up coming you stop by in the morning to say hello we sit on the bed indian fashion not touching in the middle of the night you come home from a nightclub we dont get past the bureau next day its the table and after that the chair because i want so much to sit you down suck your cock you ask me to hold your wrists but then when i touch your neck with both my hands you come its early morning and you decide to very quietly come on my knee because of the children youve been away at school for centuries your girlfriend has left you you come four times before morning you tell me you masturbated in the hotel before you came by i dont believe it i serve the lentil soup naked i massage your feet to seduce you you are reluctant my feet wind up at your neck and ankles you try not to come too quickly also you dont want to have a baby i stand up from the bath you say turn around and kiss the backs of my legs and my ass you suck my cunt for a thousand years you are weary at last i remember my fathers anger and i come you have no patience and come right away i get revenge and wont let you sleep all night we make out for so long we cant remember how we wound up hitting our heads against the wall i lie on my stomach you put one hand under me and one hand over me and that way can love me you appear without notice and with flowers i fall for it and we become missionaries you say you can only fuck me up the ass when you are drunk so we try it sober in a room at the farm we lie together one night exhausted couplets and dont make love does this mean weve had enough watching t v we wonder if each other wants to interrupt the plot later i beg you to read to me like the chinese we count thrusts then more out loud till we both come i come three times before you do and then it seems youre mad and never will its only fair for a woman to come more think of all the times they didnt care lying in dug outs joking idly wearily watching the candle guttering in the draught hearing the great shells go high over us eerily singing how often have i turned over and laughed with pity and pride photographs of all colours all sizes subjects khaki brothers in france or mothers faces worn with countless dolours or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance though in a picture only a common cheap ill taken card and children frozen some babies waiting on dicky bird to peep out of the handkerchief that is his home but hes so shy and some with bright looks calling delight across the miles of land and sea that not the dread of barrage suddenly falling could quite blot out not mud nor lethargy smiles and triumphant careless laughter o the pain of them wide earths most sacred things lying in dug outs hearing the great shells slow sailing mile high the heart mounts higher and sings but once o why did he keep that

erotic hallucination just so much feverishly produced kazoo music are you serious this large oven impersonating night this exhaustion mutilated to resemble passion the bogus moon of tenderness and magic you hold out to each prisoner like a cup of light naked for twenty four of our last thirty six hours together and i mean museum quality sex shop god riddling naked sapping gold light from the windows of her hundred year old baltimore dorm we were hungry for selling points like a couple in a showroom compelling arguments were made to close the deal and children were discussed i kissed her from heel to head in a shower without water then with nude she read me a letter as a waiter would his specials and i couldnt keep my eyes off smooth shoulders belly pelvis deep olive skin all a balm against sleep it was from her sexy grandmother in dieppe and s verine translated both of us somehow drawn to this third party in a tidal sort of way her lunar candor her antipodal ease with words and the world we were difficult s verine and i a beautiful strain a cult of two even eating we made lots of noise even resting in bed watching the trees our lighter breathing our limb shifting sheet rustling even our dreaming had fight her heart was exceptionally loud not with love but with knowing knowing what to be afraid of stand still and i will read to thee a lecture love in loves philosophy these three hours that we have spent walking here two shadows went along with us which we ourselves producd but now the sun is just above our head we do those shadows tread and to brave clearness all things are reducd so whilst our infant loves did grow disguises did and shadows flow from us and our cares but now tis not so that love has not attaind the highst degree which is still diligent lest others see except our loves at this noon stay we shall new shadows make the other way as the first were made to blind others these which come behind will work upon ourselves and blind our eyes if our loves faint and westwardly decline to me thou falsely thine and i to thee mine actions shall disguise the morning shadows wear away but these grow longer all the day but oh loves day is short if love decay love is a growing or full constant light and his first minute after noon is night ventura because she was hungry and because she was curious but more because she was curious took the dare a kiss for a pomegranate everyone gathered her friends and his everyone watched the boys the girls the pigs and the chickens and more moving to the front were the children she and clemente would one day have and the children of those children too gathered and loud with everyone and everything else loud as the pigs and fast as the chickens though she could not see them still they crowded her and she could feel their anxious breathing this boy clemente whom she would kiss she would have kissed even without the pomegranate though she could not say it and was glad of this game he suited her she thought he had a strong face he felt what she felt she could see him look around but not at their friends she could see him feel the shiver of the children they would have their son margarito his two sisters both of whom would become nuns if just to pray enough to take care of him this boy so serious he would seem like a stranger in their arms serious enough by himself to make up for clemente and ventura and for all the laughter they themselves would feel this curious child who as an old man would never trust a doctor for anything and his serious wife to come refugio and her sisters matilde and consuelo as well all the people who would follow this kiss so many of them and their children too everyone stood there arms up everyone watching so much noise in this moment this quick lending of herself to his cheek the way ventura would later kiss all these impatient children of theirs the kiss seemed so small but was filled with itself this small moment of affection she gave this boy the quarter second that it took there they all stood waiting with the crowd egging them on hefting the pomegranate and pushing them toward each other clemente and ventura in that quarter second lived their lives a quarter second not finished yet ive often wondered why she laughed on thinking why i wondered so it seemed such waste that long white hands should touch my hands and let them go and once when we were parting there unseen of anything but trees i touched her fingers thoughtfully for more than simple niceties but for some futile things unsaid i should say all is done for us yet i have wondered how she smiled beholding what was cavernous what do you remember when i looked at his streaky glasses i wanted to leave him and before that he stole those cherries for me at midnight we were walking in the rain and i loved him and before that i saw him coming toward me that time at the picnic edgy foreign but you loved him he sat in his room with the shades drawn brooding but youloved him he gave me a photo of himself at sixteen diving from the pier it was summer his arms outstretched and before that his mother was combing his soft curls with her fingers and crying crying is that what he said he put on the straw hat and raced me to the barn what did he tell you heres the dried rose brown as tobacco heres the letter that i tore and pasted the book of blank pages with the velvet cover but do you still love him when i rub the nap backwards the colors lift bristle what do you mean sometimes when im all alone i find myself stroking it ithe chair from goodwill smelled of mildew i sat with sister ann a franciscan in her small office at the cenacle retreat house right off dixie highway in lantana florida i began my story it was an interview much of life is an interview she said i did not need to pay her but donations yes donations were appreciated they could be left anonymously in a plain white envelopethat she could take back to the cloister she was dressed in a turtleneck and a denim jumper she could have been mistaken in a grocery store for an aging housewife my meetings with her went on for a few years i had come to speak about durell i did not know how to end sentences about durell he had taught me what to live not to wince in the mirror what there were so many ways to end my sentence he was an unlikely candidate for so many things outside it was always some subtle variation of summer i paused then spoke urgently not wanting to forget some fact but much i knew i would forget or remember in a way my own which would not exactly be correct no not exactly durell was dead i said and i needed to make sense of things sister anns face was open fragile parts were chipped like on a recovered fresco above her gray head a garish postcard of the emmaus scene the colors off as if painted by numbers with no concern for shading the style of it had an unoriginal catholic institutional uniformity there it hung askew in its golden drugstore frame it was the scene from the end of luke the two disciples one named cleopas the other anonymous forever mumbling christs name and with them the resurrected christ masquerading as a stranger they were on their way to that town emmaus seven miles out from jerusalem gossiping about the impress of christs vanishing they argued about whether to believe what they had seen they were restless back and forth the debate went when there is estrangement there is little peace ii every time we met sister ann prayed first at times my recollections blurred or a presumption would reverse sister ann told me durell was with me still in a more intimate way than when he lived she frequently lost her equilibrium as older people sometimes do before settling into her worn out chair where she listened to me week after week the day i met durell i said the morning light was clear startling the town with ornament the steeple of christ church held the horizon in place or so i imagined as if it had been painted firstwith confident amounts of titanium whitebefore the rest was added trees clattered the reiterating brick puzzle of cambridge brightened mass avenue mount auburn dunster holyoke proclaimed a new september and new students trudged the streets every blood warm structure was defined in relief hours before while the moons neck wobbled on the charles like a giraffes or the ghost of a giraffes neck i imagined durell labored having slept only a few hours caged in his worries of doctor bills no money and running out of people to ask for it mulling over mistakes broken love affairs a hospital orderly a man upstairs he probably mumbled unkind epithets about blacks and jews even though the men he loved were blacks and jews some of his blasphemies if you want to call them that embarrassed me in front of sister ann but she seemed unflappably tolerant at sixty he was unemployable he had taught school and guarded buildings each job ending worse than the last his refrain was always it is not easy being an impoverished aristocrat he spoke with the old harvard accent i can still hear it i will probably always hear it with new york city the north shore and the army mixed in the as broadened the rs were flat the ts snapped so a sentence would calibrate to a confident close like my dee ah boy that is that he lived on garden street in a rent controlled studioon the second floor number he said the reminded him of christmas at eleven oclock he probably pulled on his support hose increasing the circulation in his legs blotched green and black next he would have locked the door with his gold keyand moved deliberately his smile beleaguered bowing to miss littlefield in the landlords officeat the buildings dark cubbyhole of an entrance they probably spoke of queen elizabeth ii her disappointments for miss littlefield and he were royalists both then durell began to move towards me entering the square breathing heavily he might have passed the brattle advertising judgment at nuremberg inside the shut black theatrical box where the world repeated the past maximilian schell interrogated judy garland and montgomery clift marlene dietrich let the phone ring and ring maybe he passed the store sign bright orange passed ninis corner where sex magazines were stacked like a cliff maybe maybe but maybe not maybe he went another way then i recalled how the t shook that place the subway grates pushing up the scent of rat life and all things fallen mixing with leavitt peirce exuding its masculine snuff down plympton street he might have gone past the grolier which i always remembered for some reason as closed gilded with spines of poetry books for its reredos yes he probably most likely certainly did that sister ann wondered if i thought he paused i thought not poetry offered him no solutions at twelve oclock the chairperson called our aa meeting to order we called ourselves the loony nooners and met in a lutheran church basement we ate salads out of tupperware shaking the contents like dice to mix the dressing some knitted schizophrenics lit multiple cigarettes acne pocked kate wanted to be a model electroshock mike read paperbacks and an irish professor named tom welcomed tellus who could not get over nam darkened figures in the poor light we looked like the burghers of calais and smelled of brewed coffee smoke perfume urine human brine we were aristocrats of time i have twenty one years i have one week i have one day i have often thought we were like first century christians a strident hidden throng electrified by a message or another way of thinking of us is that we were inconvenient obstacles momentarily removed much to the citys relief from each window well high heels and business shoes hurried durell h as he was known to us took his place his thick hair fixed as the waves of an s nautical painting perhaps he kept it set with hair spray his tiffany ring polished to a brilliance he set himself apart in his metal folding chair he had the clotted girth of hermann g ring what was he thinking about was he thinking about blood clots and possible aneurysms imperious behind prism like trifocals quietly he said to me ive grown as fat as elizabeth taylor iii the meeting ended and durell folded his metal chair he hated his christian name durell he said who names their child durell moving among the crowd listening to success and failure he passed out meeting lists literature leaflets durell sponsored men he referred to them as pigeons i met him that day i was his last after that every day we spoke on rotary phones i was young and spoke as if my story was the only one i told him i had underlined key passages in platos symposium told him i had been graded unfairly on dantes inferno and purgatorio told him my schedule might not allow for the paradiso he matched my telling with listening advising and more listening mostly over the phone and the more he listened the more he was alone why was that sister ann asked it was some sort of offering perhaps at times it seemed he needed to guarantee a pardon that old catholic idea of indulgences lurked somewhere there unspoken as if he believed a larger offering might guarantee a larger pardon such a task demanded his increased singleness yes that was true or was it i had trouble settling on the right words with sister ann many of my words were not exactly right the syntax awkward i kept having trouble translating durell so much i guessed how to know why hadnt i asked him more questions he wasnt the sort that invited questions i do remember that another way of saying it was that when he was with me on the phone then and only then did he seem to move in truth and in his truths reprimanding and hard he was made more singular maybe that was it whatever the case he listened he listened to me i missed his listening listening sister ann said is a memorable form of love after the meeting he gave me his calling card the cards were placed inside his compulsively polished silver card case the black capitals raised on their ecru background containing his name bracketed by a mr and a jr the mr denoting lost civility the jr tallying a lineage that did not bridge as we walked down church street the bells of st john the evangelist rang the road was bright the road full behind the brown gate with the thick black rusted latch the monks sang it is well it is well with my soul with my soul we peered in at bookshop clerks locating titles watch repairmen bent over lit ocular devices fixing movements florists hands wet arranging stems and branches broken we saw ourselves reflected i laughed with deference the way a student laughs before a teacher his skin was flecked with milk blues lead whites earthen reds in dress and demeanor he was as rigid as a toy soldier for he was a part of a republic with standards atrophied devoted to order everyone found him impossible including at times me of queers his word for what he was but could not admit to he said you know in the army they could never be trusted i mentioned romantic love in profile a silhouette he paused he said it has been very vexing indeed by his tone i knew never to ask again a decorum of opprobrium kept him whole and so he guarded himself with intensity maybe sister ann suggested he was guarding me durell said ive whittled my world down to no one spencer with the possible exception of you iv what happened then sister ann asked he excused himself with a handshake his palms soft as bread doughfrom all the jergens he had slathered on and then he probably returned to his ambry of a studio a place where i would be one of his only visitors although he handed out his number he did not always answer i remember what do i remember i was free to turn away but the moment i looked back durell would come back to me waiting for me it seems to me now after all this time few things have as much fidelity as the past i remember he had nailed memorabilia above his headas one would place stones to fortify a castle a photograph of him in the army liberating people undoing russian codes a framed marriage license from england although the marriage failed he often mumbled her name his framed diploma harvard and over the corner hunghis graduation caps faded black tassel next to his pill bottles an edward viii coronation mug he doted on commemorating an event that never took place maybe he made a bread and baloney sandwich maybe he stepped over the rolled up tag sale carpet and drew the shades by late evening he might have jotted down notes about god obedient as he was to the twelve steps of aa he might have written in his tightly looped feminine penmanship informed by the palmer method and later repeated a phrase or two to me over the phone or maybe he read from his twenty four hours a day bookto find a rule maybe or to search for a sanctuary or maybe he listened to the reverend peter gomes on the radio the plummer professor of christian morals at harvard for he often mentioned how he loved the preachers parallel constructions yes maybe he did that maybe possibly he did that and then perhaps he slept a bitbefore the whole routine began once more with the support hose the hair spray miss littlefield the sex magazines the grolier the folding chair the meeting the calling card how crazy america was he said how he wanted to leave but he never left town except jolting trips to the hospitalin an ambulance down all those brick roads v i lived in cambridge two years after that wherever i moved we spoke daily over the phone on landlines talking and listening listening and talking for fifteen years you alright yes you in all that time i saw him only once more and by then he was nearly blind in all that time we barely touched one another why our relationship required its rood screen i could not fully explain to sister ann indeed i can never seem to properly explain it to anyone but i have tried and i will probably always keep trying but if i get nothing right i must try to get a nuance of our friendshipand his sponsorship right we were bound bound by a vow a vow of attention there are many causes for attention among them redemption our attention concerned the spirit although that sounds pious and we were not so pious we were more selfish more human than pious what else can i say i needed a liberatorand liberators can come in some unexpected guises i may never wholly explain the two of us perhaps the spirit defies the human mind even after all my time with sister ann finally from a hospital came the report of durells last day a charge nurse said i touched the gangrene leg pink flesh was coming back his compliments had increased the more his life failed in the final week he quoted cole porter songs to me youre a bendel bonnet a shakespeare sonnet youre mickey mouse i did not repeat the rhymes to sister ann who durell was and why he did what he did and why he hidwhat he hid i kept asking her sister ann quoted from deuteronomy i set before you life and death choose life old pigeon flying back when i arrived at the hospital his body was gone the formalities were few for he had become a ward of the state the staff gave me a brown grocery bag of his things a roll of dimes a pair of shoes a belt buckle an einstein quote something about mediocre minds afterwards i went through cambridge and found the meeting gone night was coming blindness worked on the people shops churches streets no one knew me people said where will we go and what will we eat i thought i recognized this or that face but no no too much time had passed on church street restaurants had replaced bookstores windows on mass avenue shone with chandeliers someone backed up photographing with a flash hold still they said hold still a new set of homeless people pleaded coins rattled inside the used coffee cups they shook everyone moved with packages briefcases textbooks flash cards cell phones flowers the charles advanced determined as a hearse its dark waters gathering up every unattached thing an umber granular dusk light fell on the elms over harvard yardas they swayed dark and slowlike the chords in the waltz from copelands rodeo there i stood unsure of which way to go the light had more ghosts in it as it must have had that day in emmaus vi suddenly sister ann announced our last meeting down the linoleum hallway sister katherine and sister ruth moved and prayed their numbers had dropped from seven to six and the nuns decided the retreat house would close soon the chapel and offices would be leveled and replaced with condominiums in the halls the swoosh snap of duct tape yanked pulled and cut straps tightened vans bleating and backing up into the back weather reports exchanged with the movers sister ann told me about herself that final time parents dead alcoholic brother dead the brother embarrassed she had been a nun she opened her bible on the shipping box between us leaned in her hearing aids on her silver crucifix knocking on her chest above her head a nail where the emmaus scene had hung i asked what caused him to remain why did he want freedom for me sister ann spoke then of the gospel of johnand the samaritan woman at the well the one married nearly as many times as elizabeth taylor and how when christ listened to her she became the first evangelist it was christs longest conversation with anyone sister ann said the samaritan womans life changed because christ listened to her john k from the meetings dead now too once said oh i knew durell he was odd but were all odd you know all i know nowis the more he loved me the more i loved the world vii i lost track of sister ann i have often thought about her and all the time she spent with me i have wanted to tell her now for some timethat not long after the cloister closed durells sister located me leaving a message on my answering machine it was still the time of answering machines inviting me to her winter house in boynton beach durells sister gave me directions she was quite close to me as it turned out she had some of durells belongings that she wanted me to have there isnt much she said but still i think you should have whats here durell spoke of his sister often but i did not know his family however when we met we recognized each otheras one sometimes recognizes what one has never seen before i said to her he knew me better than anyone the sentence surprised us we sat by the pool in her gated country club the florida evening was a watercolor in the making colors bleeding into striking mistakes after all the members withdrew she said there are many things you do not know about my brother a worker folded terry cloth towels under a bamboo hut her voice halted as voices halt when words have been withheld they called him names she said a nancy boy a priss a sissy a fairy the pools tempos ceased until the silence about us was the silence in a palace light disappeared everywhere the sun fell she looked away said that hed been to the army language school learned german and russian played the organ in his spare time mentioned hed taken music with copland at harvard he had received a gentlemans c the c stood for copland she said he always said which made us laugh and seemed to beckon him to us he had hoped for an army career she went on and then she mumbled something about a little german town i think she said it was in schleswig holstein near l beck where he was stationed while borders were being redrawn the letters stopping the army the men something the drink and then her words fell and sank into subtle variations of all that goes unsaid we heard the distant sound of a train on its track crossing the florida map going brown then black he became difficult isolated she spoke softly then like the penitent he was always asking for money as his requests persisted she began to screen her calls it became easier to tell him i had not been home she said his behavior was affecting her marriage she chose never to introduce her children to durell perhaps he had a mental illness perhaps he invented perhaps perhaps perhaps but no she pressed on perhaps it was his sexuality he was too sensitive people can be cruel she said she felt he had never adjusted to crueltyas if cruelty was something that one needed to adjust to later he was picked up for charges of soliciting sex and the more she told me the less i knew all about us a stillness began to displace the lightand durell was there and no longer there staining that stillness after an estrangement ends there comes a great stillness the greater the estrangement the greater the stillness across the parking lot a gate rattled i told her he often said his life had been a failure i tried to convince him otherwise but he never believed me half a century ago she broke off contact her protracted estrangement made her look ill please please she said her voice trailed off although what she was pleading for was not clear no no she did not want her grandchildren to know subtle variations of florida evening light withdrew with finality the pool brightened with moonlight the color of snow the pool was still there we were a man and a woman sitting in cushioned lounge chairs as if the world would always be an endless pair of separated things we did not touch each other we were still a long time what thing unto mine ear wouldst thou convey what secret thing o wandering water ever whispering surely thy speech shall be of her thou water o thou whispering wanderer what message dost thou bring say hath not love leaned low this hour beside thy far well head and there through jealous hollowed fingers said the thing that most i long to know murmuring with curls all dabbled in thy flow and washed lips rosy red he told it to thee there where thy voice hath a louder tone but where it welters to this little moan his will decrees that i should hear now speak for with the silence is no fear and i am all alone shall time not still endow one hour with life and i and she slake in one kiss the thirst of memory say streams lest love should disavow thy service and the bird upon the bough sing first to tell it me what whisperest thou nay why name the dead hours i mind them well their ghosts in many darkened doorways dwell with desolate eyes to know them by that hour must still be born ere it can die of that id have thee tell but hear before thou speak withhold i pray the vain behest that while the maze hath still its bower for quest my burning heart should cease to seek be sure that love ordained for souls more meek his roadside dells of rest stream when this silver thread in flood time is a torrent brown may any bulwark bind thy foaming crown shall not the waters surge and spread and to the crannied boulders of their bed still shoot the dead drift down let no rebuke find place in speech of thine or it shall prove that thou dost ill expound the words of love even as thine eddys rippling race would blur the perfect image of his face i will have none thereof o learn and understand that gainst the wrongs himself did wreak love sought her aid until her shadowy cheek and eyes beseeching gave command and compassed in her close compassionate hand my heart must burn and speak for then at last we spoke what eyes so oft had told to eyes through that long lingering silence whose half sighs alone the buried secret broke which with snatched hands and lips reverberate stroke then from the heart did rise but she is far away now nor the hours of night grown hoar bring yet to me long gazing from the door the wind stirred robe of roseate gray and rose crown of the hour that leads the day when we shall meet once more dark as thy blinded wave when brimming midnight floods the glen bright as the laughter of thy runnels when the dawn yields all the light they crave even so these hours to wound and that to save are sisters in loves ken oh sweet her bending grace then when i kneel beside her feet and sweet her eyes oerhanging heaven and sweet the gathering folds of her embrace and her falln hair at last shed round my face when breaths and tears shall meet beneath her sheltering hair in the warm silence near her breast our kisses and our sobs shall sink to rest as in some still trance made aware that day and night have wrought to fulness there and love has built our nest and as in the dim grove when the rains cease that hushed them long mid glistening boughs the song birds wake to song so from our hearts deep shrined in love while the leaves throb beneath around above the quivering notes shall throng till tenderest words found vain draw back to wonder mute and deep and closed lips in closed arms a silence keep subdued by memorys circling strain the wind rapt sound that the wind brings again while all the willows weep then by her summoning art shall memory conjure back the sere autumnal springs from many a dying year born dead and bitter to the heart the very ways where now we walk apart who then shall cling so near and with each thought new grown some sweet caress or some sweet name low breathed shall let me know her thought the same making me rich with every tone and touch of the dear heaven so long unknown that filled my dreams with flame pity and love shall burn in her pressed cheek and cherishing hands and from the living spirit of love that stands between her lips to soothe and yearn each separate breath shall clasp me round in turn and loose my spirits bands oh passing sweet and dear then when the worshipped form and face are felt at length in darkling close embrace round which so oft the sun shone clear with mocking light and pitiless atmosphere in many an hour and place ah me with what proud growth shall that hours thirsting race be run while for each several sweetness still begun afresh endures loves endless drouth sweet hands sweet hair sweet cheeks sweet eyes sweet mouth each singly wooed and won yet most with the sweet soul shall loves espousals then be knit what time the governing cloud sheds peace from it oer tremulous wings that touch the goal and on the unmeasured height of loves control the lustral fires are lit therefore when breast and cheek now part from long embraces free each on the other gazing shall but see a self that has no need to speak all things unsought yet nothing more to seek one love in unity o water wandering past albeit to thee i speak this thing o water thou that wanderest whispering thou keepst thy counsel to the last what spell upon thy bosom should love cast its secret thence to wring nay must thou hear the tale of the past days the heavy debt of life that obdurate time withholds ere yet to win thine ear these prayers prevail and by thy voice loves self with high all hail yield up the amulet how should all this be told all the sad sum of wayworn days hearts anguish in the impenetrable maze and on the waste uncoloured wold the visible burthen of the sun grown cold and the moons labouring gaze alas shall hope be nursd on lifes all succouring breast in vain and made so perfect only to be slain or shall not rather the sweet thirst even yet rejoice the heart with warmth dispersd and strength grown fair again stands it not by the door loves hour till she and i shall meet with bodiless form and unapparent feet that cast no shadow yet before though round its head the dawn begins to pour the breath that makes day sweet its eyes invisible watch till the dials thin thrown shade be born yea till the journeying line be laid upon the point that wakes the spell and there in lovelier light than tongue can tell its presence stands arrayd its soul remembers yet those sunless hours that passed it by and still it hears the nights disconsolate cry and feels the branches wringing wet cast on its brow that may not once forget dumb tears from the blind sky but oh when now her foot draws near for whose sake night and day were long in weary longing sighed away the hour of love mid airs grown mute shall sing beside the door and loves own lute thrill to the passionate lay thou knowst for love has told within thine ear o stream how soon that song shall lift its sweet appointed tune o tell me for my lips are cold and in my veins the blood is waxing old even while i beg the boon so in that hour of sighs assuaged shall we beside this stone yield thanks for grace while in thy mirror shown the twofold image softly lies until we kiss and each in others eyes is imaged all alone still silent can no art of loves then move thy pity nay to thee let nothing come that owns his sway let happy lovers have no part with thee nor even so sad and poor a heart as thou hast spurned to day to day lo night is here the glen grows heavy with some veil risen from the earth or falln to make earth pale and all stands hushed to eye and ear until the night wind shake the shade like fear and every covert quail ah by another wave on other airs the hour must come which to thy heart my love shall call me home between the lips of the low cave against that night the lapping waters lave and the dark lips are dumb but there loves self doth stand and with lifes weary wings far flown and with deaths eyes that make the water moan gathers the water in his hand and they that drink know nought of sky or land but only love alone o soul sequestered face far off o were that night but now so even beside that stream even i and thou through thirsting lips should draw loves grace and in the zone of that supreme embrace bind aching breast and brow o water whispering still through the dark into mine ears as with mine eyes is it not now with hers mine eyes that add to thy cold spring wan water wandering water weltering this hidden tide of tears no more walks in the wood the trees have all been cut down and where once they stood not even a wagon rut appears along the path low brush is taking over no more walks in the wood this is the aftermath of afternoons in the clover fields where we once made love then wandered home together where the trees arched above where we made our own weather when branches were the sky now they are gone for good and you for ill and i am only a passer by we and the trees and the way back from the fields of play lasted as long as we could no more walks in the wood if i could be anyting i would be a rich white girl and i am almost halfway there i straightened my hair before it rained now all i can do is pray i dont mean that figuratively im living in this logocentrism where did i get these spanish thighs i was crying in the food court because im afraid of the spiritual anorexia that i crave i wrote out a prayer in reportorial style like a good protestant obsessed with achieving the androgyny of my time i cut when my boyfriend said i had the figure of an average hispanic girl so what was i so upset about i decided to try liposuction at home so much splendor is owed to dysmorphia and a fucked perspective like those gothic spires poking the heavens that someone just thought up like can we tap this broomstick on ethereal marble floors or what can we really do my mother was married by the water she wore a gray coat and a winter rose she said her vows beside a cold seam of the irish coast she said her vows near the shore wherethe emigrants set down their consonantal n on afternoon on the end of everything at the start of ever yellow vestments took in light a chalice hid underneath its veil her hands were full of calla and cold weather lilies the mail packet dropped anchor a black headed gull swerved across the harbor icy promises rose beside a crosshatch of ocean and horizon i am waiting for the words of the service i am waiting for keep thee only and all my earthly all i hear is an afternoons worth of never prurient tapirs gamboled on our lawns but that was quite some time ago now one is accosted by asthmatic bulldogs sluggish in the hedges ruminant moving through ivy in the park near drying waterfalls we open every gate but that grave shell white unicorn is gone the path is strewn with papers to the street numbers that once were various regarded us were thought significant significant enough to bring reporters to the scene but now the bell strikes one strikes one strikes one monotonous and tired or clicks like a sad valise note to be left on the table this ghost of yours padding about the upper halls given to fright wigs burbage might have worn moaning in doorways jumping out at maids has not convinced me even yet can this be you your life was frightening enough but this poor pallid counterpart who fuddles in its role is inexcusable go haunt the houses of the girls you once infected or the men who bore your company far oftener than i annoy the others for a change is this my house the medieval hell you took to at the graves edge years ago after a dozen other hells had burned themselves away or are we purgatory here if not you make it one i give you until noon ruined travelers in sad trousseaux roost on my doorstep indolent and worn not one of them fulfills despised rousseaus predictions perhaps they are waiting to be born if so the spots been badly chosen this is a site for posthumous investigations pillows stuffed with nettles charnal notions apoplectic executioners bungled incisions indeed our solitary midwife fondles the hemlock we welcomed one poor hackneyed christ sad bastard croaking of pestilence the basement holds him now he has not as yet arisen the tickets are ready the line forms on the right justice and virtue you will find have been amazingly preserved as water from a dwindling reservoir uncovers mossy stones new banks of silt so every minute that i spend with you reveals new flaws new features new intangibles we have been sitting here for hours i spent that summer in madrid the winter on the coast of france the millotsons were there and farnsworth my work has perished with the rest of europe gone all gone we will not see the end you said goodbye and your perfume lingered for hours at first it seemed like summer dying there then rank and sharp and yet i did not air the room among victorian beadwork and the smell of plush the owls stuffed and marvelously sinister glare from dark corners waiting for the night high up the mooses passive eyes explore candles unlit within cut glass a door is opened and you enter with a look you might have saved for pliny or the pope the furniture has shrunk now thirty years have passed with talent thinning out and words gone dead and mouths of friends in photographs display their hopeful and outmoded smiles you counted on at least a sputter of nostalgia however fretful that was a mistake even the moose regards you with a tired uncomprehending stare signboards commemorate their resting place the graveless of another century came and were conquered now their bones are dust where idiot highways run land in their eyes unquiet ancestors on fences yellow signs clang in the wind unstirred by suns drying the brown weeds above them now in parched and caking land but when they speak of you they feel the need of voices polished and revised by history the martial note words framed in capitals it is good to be deaf in a deafening time with the sky gone colorless while the dead thunder breaks a cracked dish out of the mind the eye no longer single where the bowl dead in the thickened darkness swelled with light transformed the images and moved the artists hand becomes a framework for our mania and haunts the stairway friends depart taking their last look from the roof saying goodnight and carrying their view of grapes the model ate in paris years ago blue in the morning green some afternoons the night ambiguous forgets the signature the dust in attics settled and his stove grew cold about the model nothing much is known it ends the wall and complements the view of chimneys and it hides a stain and when your beauty washed away in impure streams with my desire is only topic for ill mannered minds gifted and glassy with exact recall gossip and rancid footnotes or remote despair let ruined weather perish in the streets and let the worlds black lying flag come down only in calendars that mark no spring can there be weather in the mind that moves to you again as you are now tired after love and silent in this house your back turned to me quite alone standing with one hand raised to smooth your hair at a small window green with rain i fanny was younger once than she is now and prettier of course i do not mean to say that there are wrinkles on her brow yet to be candid she is past eighteen perhaps past twenty but the girl is shy about her age and heaven forbid that i ii should get myself in trouble by revealing a secret of this sort i have too long

comes home he tells her about it as he speaks his breath condenses in front of his face she goes about her business every now and then she looks over she doesnt hear his voice she sees the soft fog that continues to form a halo she knows he is still talking about that place he never tires of it like she does only on summer days when the air is hot and moisture is still a long time in coming she asks him to tell her about that place she sits facing him waiting for the first vocalic non stops the push of air from his lips he tells her of the place where clouds are formed the cool dampness of his voice is rich even on a dry june day her face beads with wetness as he talks directly to her each aspirated sound a gentle burst of coolness tell me again tell me again she teases if he knew she only wanted relief from the heat and not the story he would stop talking he begins the first time i saw the place where clouds are formed was from the window of a train another time was in a mirage in the heat outside tucson once he thought he saw it in the dry light of stars the place he remembers best was when he saw it in the eyes of a woman he spoke to when he first noticed it she hid it by lowering her gaze soon she let him look freely there were times when she opened her eyes wide allowing an unobscured view sometimes he saw her eyes smolder with dryness on a summer day other times she was rich with moisture clouds came in succession the earths shadows muted you know the forty days and forty nights i was there ill be there when it happens again she said with a slight smile like a child he rushed to look into her eyes at every opportunity if he could he would hang on her eye socket peering inside marveling at her displays ii an unusually cold december day right around christmas

head to foot oblivious of spines needles rubbery hide surrounded soothed by elements contact triggers stored heat of remembered summers moisture beads roll forward unstoppable from the city below we see mist rising mist rising iii we sit close in the cab of the truck the weather is cold wet outside too messy to stand in waiting for a school bus my fathers truck is warm inside having been at work since four a m the sound of the engine is soothing heater working to capacity inside the cab we are silent we dont need language we listen to the regular hum of the engine rhythm of the windshield wipers soft rain on the hood aware of the cold air surrounding our temporary shelter we look out over the fields where fog clings to the soil every now and then with the back of his gloved hand he wipes the windshield is it coming yet the three of us sit quietly breathing clouds clouds condense as they contact the coolness of the windows my father appears to breathe air with temperature in balance he forms no clouds he watches us we continue to breathe gray soft mist waiting for the school bus to say screw them to be screw them bent on one thing all but lost one music or mystery beyond all the necessary incidental snaggings of the heart to train the whole souls beam on a solitary hill or on it a special kind of rock or creeper to be sated just by saxophone to want nothing but your

the edge of the tub she stood behind him reaching around in the mirror her face rose over his shoulder like the moon and like the moon she regarded him beautifully but without feeling and he looked at her as he would at the moon how beautiful how distant no smiling no weeping no talking a man and a woman transacting their magnificent business with the usual equanimity the man as a passenger walking the ships deck at evening and the woman as the moon over his shoulder oiling the ocean with light deep in the ships belly pistons churned and sailors fed the boilers roar with coal on deck just the engines dull thrum and a faint click as the woman sets her ring on the cool white lip of the sink you take off your black motorcycle jacket hang it on the back of a chair its cold from our walk along the sea wall your pockets jingle with shells while we were gone you left the stove on low some things you do make me so nervous you graze the surface of sauce simmering in a pan shiny fingertip held out for me to lick you say what does it need maybe nothing maybe honey to unbitter the lime later that night youll bury your face in my belly and sob im sorry though i dont think you are always talking to me my love but now lobster steam billows up the window you gulp purple wine your pinky sticking out and the round olives are the green all green things aspire to be coming east we left the

they once longed for a day a year ago last summer god filled me with himself like gold inside deeper inside than marrow this close to god this close to you walking into the river at wolf with the animals the snakes green skin lit from inside our second life a youth for jane with ardour sighed the maid with sparkling eye but to his vows she still replied ill hear you by and by suspense he cries my bloom decays and bids my spirits fly now hear my vows but still she says ill hear you by and by at length her frowns his love subdue he shuns her scornful eye and emma seeks wholl hear him woo both

busy now said he but jane ill hear you by and by loves balustrade loves balcony a few iron words that can be seen anywhere still in grocery lists in laundry hung between two objects an e mail in an apology in a thought about the weather these rusty words these rusting gates before a breath standing in the cold morning on a cold blue stairs with a curlicue of coffee you look at the word love written on the side of the pharmacy in cherry vanilla flavored cursive because this is where a love poem once stood what i am saying right now is secretly built over a love poem the fossils of a cupola pink buildings with red hyphens and dashes and three red dots you second person pink with shutters you could open with a fingernail like in an advent calendar to see sticker scenes of apartments inside a radiator a bare arm two cups by themselves on a table the mind of the attic still persists up there meditative water and the chairs talking quietly to one another its now pink rubble rhyming bricks and an illicit balcony the heart had such a fancy elevator that it started to look like a bird cage and once in a lemon scented fog near springtime fresh trees i heard two people say yellow kiss shaped flowers telephone flowers are falling from my mouth now now its a set of blue and white checkered apartment buildings math problems that are eight stories high a long division jutting as pollution into the sky laundry cooking spills gasoline shirts commas theories or arguments of boyfriends girlfriends boyfriends boyfriends girlfriends girlfriends all hanging out of the window that you opened come the wind may never again blow as now it blows for us and the stars may never again shine as now they shine long before october returns seas of blood will have parted us and you must crush the love in your heart and i the love in mine when this day returns to mei will value your heart long hurt in long division over mine mouth above mine too say you love me truth never moremeant say you are angry words words we net with our mouths soul is an old thirst but not as firstas the bodys perhaps though on bad nights its melancholyeats us out to a person true time is undigressing yet true is all we can be rhyming you rhyming me love brought by night a vision to my bed one that still wore the vesture of a child but eighteen years of age who sweetly smiled till of the lovely form false hopes were bred and keen embraces wild ah for the lost desire that haunts me yet till mine eyes fail in sleep that finds no more that fleeting ghost oh lovelorn heart give oer cease thy vain dreams of beautys warmth forget the face thou longest for it would have been a fine path for a lizard to crossbut i saw none brambles and sweet briar grewon the town side poppies and wild grasses on the river too hot for birds the ducks were out in water and mud and frogs were out by the hundreds it seemed saying way way in their deepest voices it was beautiful therebut id seen beauty and its opposite so oftenthat when warmth broke over my skin i remembered winter the way fresh grief undoes you the moment youre fully awake when she turned two i asked my young friendwhat she would serve at her birthday party and she said tofu and cupcakes when she was three and i was very sadshe called and said what are you doing picking flowers she talked in poems like she was dreaming all the timeor very old or virginia woolf more often in the first world one wakes from not to the nightmare when i dreamed i lost my love i willed myself awake because i would notsurvive the pain again even dreaming which is responsiblefor that mercy doktor the conscious or the un i wantthe poppies picked and i want the poppies left where they grow like looking through the window of a moving

perpendicular to the road things entirely themselves arriving in the deep double shadows of the grass and passersby everyone comes here from a long way off is a line from a poem i read last night driving up in the haze they talked and talked smoke in the air shimmering from wildfires his story was sad and hers was roiled troubled alternatively a man and a woman old friends are in a theaterwatching a movie in which a man and a woman old friends are driving through summer on a mountain road the woman is describing the end of her marriageand sobbing shaking her head and laughingand sobbing the man is watching the road listening his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance and because in the restaurant before the filmthe woman had been describing the end of her marriageand cried they are not sure whether they are in the theateror on the mountain road and when the timber truckcomes suddenly around the bend they both flinch he found that it was no good trying to tellwhat happened that day everything he saidseemed fictional the moment that he said it the rain the scent of her hair what she saidas she was leaving and why it was importantfor him to explain that the car had been parkedunder eucalyptus on a hillside and how velvetyand blurred the trees looked through the windshield not he said that making fictions might not bethe best way of getting at it but that nothing he saidhad the brute abject unassimilated qualityof a wounding experience the ego in any tellingwas already seeing itself as a character and a character he said was exactly what he was not at that moment even as he kept wanting to explain to someone to whomever would listen that she had closed the doorso quietly and so firmly that the beads of rainon the side window didnt even quiver names

at this recognition and at a certain memory that attended it and then laughed at the thought that he hadactually stimulated himself with an analysisof her style and she said as if she were rememberingthe way he could make her insecure what what are you smiling about and he said nothing and she said oh yes right i remember nothing two jokes walk into a bar a cage went in search of a bird a boy walks out in the morning with a gun three rabbis walk into a penguin in the other world the girls were named eleanor and filina and one night it was very warm and they could not sleepfor the heat and the stillness and they went outside beyond the wall of their parents garden and into a meadow it was a dark night moonless and the stars were so thickthey seemed to shudder and the sisters stood a long timein the sweet smell of the cooling grasses looking at the skyand listening in the silence after a while they heard a stirringand saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching themfrom the woods edge maybe its their friend the bear one of the children said i dont like this story said the other matilde years or days sleeping feverish here or there gazing off twisting my spine bleeding true blood perhaps i awaken or am lost sleeping hospital beds foreign windows white uniforms of the silent walkers the clumsiness of feet and then these journeys and my sea of renewal your head on the pillow your hands floating in the light in my light over my earth it was beautiful to live when you lived the world is bluer and of the earth at night when i sleep enormous within your small hands there is no stillness in this wood the quiet of this clearing is the denial of my hearing the sounds i should there is no vision in this glade this tower of sun revealing the timbered scaffoldage is stealing essence from shade only my love is loves ideal the love i could discover in these recesses knows no lover is the unreal the undefined unanalysed unabsolute many it is antithesis of any in none comprised now sleeps the crimson petal now the white nor waves the cypress in the palace walk nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font the firefly wakens waken thou with me now droops the milk white peacock like a ghost and like a ghost she glimmers on to me now lies the earth all dana to the stars and all thy heart lies open unto me now slides the silent meteor on and leaves a shining furrow as thy thoughts in me now folds the lily all her sweetness up and slips into the bosom of the lake so fold thyself my dearest thou and slip into my bosom and be lost in me you that are dear o you above the rest forgive him his evasive moods and cold the absence that belied him oft of old the war upon sad speech the desperate jest and pitys wildest gush but half confessed forgive him let your gentle memories hold some written word once tender and once bold or service done shamefacedly at best whereby to judge him all his days he spent like one who with an angel wrestled well oermastering love with show of light disdain and whatsoer your spirits underwent he wounded for you worked no miracle to make his hearts allegiance wholly plain i would like to decorate this silence but my house grows only cleaner and more plain the glass chimes i hung over the register ring a little when the heat goes on i waited too long to drink my tea it was not hot it

basket of red potatoes i want to remember us this way late september sun streaming through the window bread loaves and golden bunches of grapes on the table spoonfuls of hot soup rising to our lips filling us with what endures o thou my lovely boy who in thy powr dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour who hast by waning grown and therein showst thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst

minion of her pleasure she may detain but not still keep her treasure her audit though delayed answered must be and her quietus is to render thee come away come away death and in sad cypress let me be laid fly away fly away breath i am slain by a fair cruel maid my shroud of white stuck all with yew o prepare it my part of death no one so true did share it not a flower not a flower sweet on my black coffin let there be strown not a friend not a friend greet my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown a thousand thousand sighs to save lay me o where sad true lover never find my grave to weep there i know what my heart is like since your love died it is like a hollow ledge holding a little pool left there by the tide a little tepid pool drying inward from the edge a glimpse through an interstice caught of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar room around the stove late of a winter night and i unremarkd seated in a corner of a youth who loves me and whom i love silently approaching and seating himself near that he may hold me by the hand a long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and oath and smutty jest there we two content happy in being together speaking little perhaps not a word how she let her long hair down over her shoulders making a love cave around her face return and return again how when the lamplight was lowered she pressed against him twining her fingers in his return and return again how their legs swam together like dolphins and their toes played like little tunnies return and return again how she sat beside him cross legged telling him stories of her childhood return and return again how she closed her eyes when his were open how they breathed together breathing each other return and return again how they fell into slumber their bodies curled together like two spoons return and return again how they went together to otherwhere the fairest land they had ever seen return and return again o best of all nights return and return again come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang in height and cold the splendour of the hills but cease to move so near the heavens and ceaseto glide a sunbeam by the blasted pine to sit a star upon the sparkling spire and come for love is of the valley come for love is of the valley come thou downand find him by the happy threshold he or hand in hand with plenty in the maize or red with spirted purple of the vats or foxlike in the vine nor cares to walkwith death and morning on the silver horns nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice that huddling slant in furrow cloven fallsto roll the torrent out of dusky doors but follow let the torrent dance thee downto find him in the valley let the wildlean headed eagles yelp alone and leavethe monstrous ledges there to slope and spilltheir thousand wreaths of dangling water smoke that like a broken purpose waste in air so waste not thou but come for all the valesawait thee azure pillars of the heartharise to thee the children call and ithy shepherd pipe and sweet is every sound sweeter thy voice but every sound is sweet myriads of rivulets hurrying thro the lawn the moan of doves in immemorial elms and murmuring of innumerable bees coming together it is easier to work after our bodies meet paper and pen neither care nor profit whether we write or not but as your body moves under my hands charged and waiting we cut the leash you create me against your thighs hilly with images moving through our word countries my body writes into your flesh the poem you make of me touching you i catch midnight as moon fires set in my throat i love you flesh into blossom i made you and take you made into me matarose never

comesboom mata mataboom mata mata home i among the smoke and fog of a december afternoon you have the scene arrange itself as it will seem to do with i have saved this afternoon for you and four wax candles in the darkened room four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead an atmosphere of juliets tomb prepared for all the things to be said or left unsaid we have been let us say to hear the latest pole transmit the preludes through his hair and finger tips so intimate this chopin that i think his soul should be resurrected only among friends some two or three who will not touch the bloom that is rubbed and questioned in the concert room and so the conversation slips among velleities and carefully caught regrets through attenuated tones of violins mingled with remote cornets and begins you do not know how much they mean to me my friends and how how rare and strange it is to find in a life composed so much so much of odds and ends for indeed i do not love it you knew you are not blind how keen you are to find a friend who has these qualities who has and gives those qualities upon which friendship lives how much it means that i say this to you without these friendships life what cauchemar among the winding of the violins and the ariettes of cracked cornets inside my brain a dull tom tom begins absurdly hammering a prelude of its own capricious monotone that is at least one definite false note let us take the air in a tobacco trance admire the monuments discuss the late events correct our watches by the public clocks then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks ii now that lilacs are in bloom she has a bowl of lilacs in her room and twists one in her fingers while she talks ah my friend you do not know you do not know what life is you who hold it in your hands slowly twisting the lilac stalks you let it flow from you you let it flow and youth is cruel and has no remorse and smiles at situations which it cannot see i smile of course and go on drinking tea yet with these april sunsets that somehow recall my buried life and paris in the spring i feel immeasurably at peace and find the world to be wonderful and youthful after all the voice returns like the insistent out of tune of a broken violin on an august afternoon i am always sure that you understand my feelings always sure that you feel sure that across the gulf you reach your hand you are invulnerable you have no achilles heel you will go on and when you have prevailed you can say at this point many a one has failed but what have i but what have i my friend to give you what can you receive from me only the friendship and the sympathy of one about to reach her journeys end i shall sit here serving tea to friends i take my hat how can i make a cowardly amends for what she has said to me you will see me any morning in the park reading the comics and the sporting page particularly i remark an english countess goes upon the stage a greek was murdered at a polish dance another bank defaulter has confessed i keep my countenance i remain self possessed except when a street piano mechanical and tired reiterates some worn out common song with the smell of hyacinths across the garden recalling things that other people have desired are these ideas right or wrong iii the october night comes down returning as before except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease i mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door and feel as if i had mounted on my hands and knees and so you are going abroad and when do you return but thats a useless question you hardly know when you are coming back you will find so much to learn my smile falls heavily among the bric brac perhaps you can write to me my self possession flares up for a second this is as i had reckoned i have been wondering frequently of late but our beginnings never know our ends why we have not developed into friends i feel like one who smiles and turning shall remark suddenly his expression in a glass my self possession gutters we are really in the dark for everybody said so all our friends they all were sure our feelings would relate so closely i myself can hardly understand we must leave it now to fate you will write at any rate perhaps it is not too late i shall sit here serving tea to friends and i must borrow every changing shape to find expression dance dance like a dancing bear cry like a parrot chatter like an ape let us take the air in a tobacco trance well and what if she should die some afternoon afternoon grey and smoky evening yellow and rose should die and leave me sitting pen in hand with the smoke coming down above the housetops doubtful for quite a while not knowing what to feel or if i understand or whether wise or foolish tardy or too soon would she not have the advantage after all this music is successful with a dying fall now that we talk of dying and should i have the right to smile to clasp you now and feel your head close pressed scented and warm against my beating breast to whisper soft and quivering your name and drink the passion burning in your frame to lie at full length taut with cheek to cheek and tease your mouth with kisses till you speak love words mad words dream words sweet senseless words melodious like notes of mating birds to hear you ask if i shall love always and myself answer till the end of days to feel your easeful sigh of happiness when on your trembling lips i murmur yes it is so sweet we know it is not true what matters it the night must shed her dew we know it is not true but it is sweet the poem with this music is complete i want to be a passenger in your car again and shut my eyes while you sit at the wheel awake and assured in your own private world seeing all the lines on the road ahead down a long stretch of empty highway without any other faces in sight i want to be a passenger in your car again and put my life back in your hands they amputated your thighs off my hips as far as im concerned they are all surgeons all of them they dismantle us each from the other as far as im concerned they are all engineers all of them a pity we were such a good and loving invention an aeroplane made from a man and wife wings and everything we hovered a little above the earth we even flew a little be the mistress of my choice clean in manners clear in voice be she witty more than wise pure enough though not precise be she showing in her dress like a civil wilderness that the curious may detect order in a sweet neglect be she rolling in her eye tempting all the passers by and each ringlet of her hair an enchantment or a snare for to catch the lookers on but herself held fast by none let her lucrece all day be thais in the night to me be she such as neither will famish me nor overfill give give me back that trifle you despise give back my heart with all its injuries tho by your cruelty it wounded be the thing is yet of wondrous use to me a genrous conqueror when the battles won bestows a charity on the undone if from the well aimd stroke no hope appear he kills the wretch and shews compassion there but you barbarian keep alive pain a lasting trophy of unjust disdain your words my friend right healthful caustics blame my young mind marred whom love doth windlass so that mine own writings like bad servants show my wits quick in vain thoughts in virtue lame that plato i read for nought but if he tame such coltish gyres that to my birth i owe nobler desires least else that friendly foe great expectation wear a train of shame for since mad march great promise made of me if now the may of my years much decline what can be hoped my harvest time will be sure you say well your wisdoms golden mine dig deep with learnings spade now tell me this hath this world ought so fair as stella is love is a sickness full of woes all remedies refusing a plant that with most cutting grows most barren with best using why so more we enjoy it more it dies if not enjoyed it sighting cries heigh ho love is a torment of the mind a tempest everlasting and jove hath made it of a kind not well not full nor fasting why so more we enjoy it more it dies if not enjoyed it sighing cries heigh ho

theres no one to tighten the valve it courses through old pipes down to the septic tank next morning in the cellar i start the motor with a stick it shakes and rumbles and chirps the switch is broken is all at night the water arrives illegally undergroundly to the very grave where last spring parsley sprouted and at the foot beside it feral sorrel darkens tastily and tartly like clandestine sex the motor lifts the spirits and returns the nights deductions its morning i hum softly a stranger will replace me in the cellar a stream of light rinses the window grate it pulses strikes the meter i catch my rhythm on the stairs and for memorys sake i hum as i pass the septic tank a fluid underground song about sorrel and a stranger evening falls someones playing a dulcimernorthampton style on the porch out back its voice touches and parts the air of summer as if it swam to time us down a riverwhere we dive and leave a single trackas evening falls someones playing a dulcimerthat lets us wash our mix of dreams together delicate tacit we engage in our act its voice touches and parts the air of summer when we disentangle you are not with heri am not with him redress calls for tact evening falls someones playing a dulcimerstill a small breeze rises and the leaves stiras uneasy as we while the woods go black its voice touches and parts the air of summerand lets darkness enter us our strings go slackthough the player keeps up his plangent attack evening falls someones playing a dulcimer its voice touches and parts the air of summer i want to write a love poem for the girls i kissed in seventh grade a song for what we did on the floor in the basement of somebodys parents house a hymn for what we didnt say but thought that feels good or i like that when we learned how to open each others mouths how to move our tongues to make somebody moan we called it practicing and one was the boy and we paired off maybe six or eight girls and turned out the lights and kissed and kissed until we were stoned on kisses and lifted our nightgowns or let the straps drop and now you be the boy concrete floor sleeping bag or couch playroom game room train room laundry lindas basement was like a boat with booths and portholes instead of windows glorias father had a bar downstairs with stools that spun plush carpeting we kissed each others throats we sucked each others breasts and we left marks and never spoke of it upstairs outdoors in daylight not once we did it and it was practicing and slept sprawled so our legs still locked or crossed a hand still lost in someones hair and we grew up and hardly mentioned who the first kiss really was a girl like us still sticky with moisturizer wed shared in the bathroom i want to write a song for that thick silence in the dark and the first pure thrill of unreluctant desire just before wed made ourselves stop whenas in silks my julia goes then then methinks how sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes next when i cast mine eyes and see that brave vibration each way free o how that glittering taketh me i read your poem over and over in this landscape of women women purring on balconies overlooking the indigo sea my mothers blue taffeta dress is black as the sea she glides out my door to the beach where sleek white boats are anchored under a full luscious moon still i am still the wind outside my window my mothers ghost evaporates in the long atlantic night i listen to the radio every chance i get for news of your citys latest disaster everything here the color of honey and sand everything there verges on catastrophe a constant preoccupation with real estate everything here a calm horizon taut bodies carefully nurtured oiled gleaming hair skin i read your poem over and over turning my head from prying eyes the low hum of women singing in another room i switch stations on the radio turn up the volume i almost touch the air buzzing electricity james brown live at the apollo the smooth female d j interrupts bo diddley groaning im a man it is a joke here in this baby blue resort where art is a full time hobby art is what everyone claims to do women sprawl like cats on each others laps licking the salt off each others skin and i walk in search of the portuguese fishermen who hide in the scorched trees the bleak blond dunes that line the highway i imagine you asleep in another city i take your poem apart line by line it is a love letter we wrote each other some time ago trying in vain to pinpoint that first easy thrill dying dad wanted sunscreen nonstop frantic if withheld would sayscreen and we just did it knew he was dying was angry in last weeks wore red sleepmask over eyes day and night would ride it up onto his forehead for brief intervals then down pulled by hand that still worked a bit sometimes shaking too much so just cried eyes cried now now once cried out light more like a hiss was there for that yanked it quick needed it so badly the bandage the world is a short place wanted the illustration of it gone wanted to not see out wanted no out but i am guessing the vineyards down the slope each latent bud beginning to plump in the distance mountains beyond sea all of it distraction but from what a waste of what the red sleepmask i should have burned it with the rest but kept it the pane made trees look painted on silky not good silky in the next valley once hammering thought it human at first the woodpeckers went on for days a carnival of searching for void how full void is small tufts of grass growing so that i can keep track taking root is not an easy way to go about finding a place to stay maybe nothing would happen after all the hollowing out now added to by crickets spiders making roads in sky i watch look at then through what is the empty part where can find nothing that is empty seems i should and soon aswhere would he go or what would the indented place on the bed where he had been be be full of he was a settler in that flesh that i could see not far from breaking camp wrapping up the organs in their separate parts skin rolled away eyes rolled elsewhere the fingers tossed aside ash ash the whole like a dime toss whom do i love what part whats in the whom whats in the late is there actually a too late because if there is i do not grasp it mask he calls unable to get into wheelchair any longer stares for bit of time into the air out front past feet out the glass door to the olive tree and fig is there fire in the distance squints once back up the ray of light up back its long road how far mask now the cremation decision driving its roots through us all roots spreading wildly beyond the shadows of the head neighbors will continue to feed stump book says long after it is cut will send it sugars phosphorous nitrogen all the surrounding trees will try via fungi root hairs send carbon send enzymes whole forest hears stress signals will mourn like the elephant ive wrapped stumps in black plastic when theyve refused to die says leila location wellington posted years ago on permagardening but then guard down eyes gone a red cotton mask an old twa one elastic gone cries out if it slips off wants blue blanket says blue angry who was not angry nothing enough wants to see all daily tests read the bloodwork wants trans fusions which we withhold would open him to infection would buy no time im wearing the sleepmask now im trying it on rubberband soft with age adding more age american red red full of noise of artificial time feels like my face is painted on a spirit upturned ancient without expression an old stream flows alongside glimmering tongues promise the vanishing will be swift its a lie the periphery disappears but i can still feel it our knowing whats coming a thicket we got lost in till the only thing is now mask my spirit screams mask now vacancy not coming fast enough before we have to traverse the riddling disappearances extinction says the mask go away now i do not want to see you any longer beauty you are too near too near i hear a blackbird and the shoo of air where it lifts off why wont you just go you circling winds leaves birds systems directions visibles invisibles honeysuckle limbs and rose gaining self song motion entering this continuum oh continuum do not lie to me with this delicate weight of time this floating of as ifs and further ons and all your guides to dreaming abundance the coming true of the true no from under here listening hard light feels around me almost visible doused with benzene and time goes away and my eyes feel on them the small weight the minuscule no to things which i can conjure which i think i know by heart but no i do not i need the mask and it feels like an idea we are in a cave now it is a hundred million years ago they will bring the meds again now and the urine pot he yells for it but for now under the mask it is a lowly spot you can make dawn come you can feel us inherit the earth the jay shifts in the tree and you can hear it there is little you hear the little hear the head snapped on the stem hear the angel trapped in the stone hear pure chance which sounds like a boy marching alongside an army wanting to enlist the year is bce you hear the outline in the tree why because it touches the other outlines if i try to raise the mask the hand he can barely use flutters angry bird wing at me would hit me with finger wings but too broken maybe in lees army maybe in grants it made no difference in the end maybe in caesars maybe in christs the trillions seem more clear than ever in the day behind the mask the dark gray of the fever feels every inch of the bark freckled the pure proclamations being made by the light it is not day it is saying bright as quicklime text of flames he can hear no not day day sprawls under to let us flow through over its parched back lies flat lie flat day he thinks under the red mask spread yourself over us light the dead at antietam yes his people both sides the cufflinks in the drawer he will not see again they were lees he would say they were grants i saw the will of the davis side i did he says smell of gravel coming from the path day sitting now over us like a lioness it is neither dark nor light as if you are the place where the branch was sawed off that place on the oak and air silently touched your new raw end you put it on you pull it down and then effort enlistment singing and you are given a fine practitioners absence you are a purpose surrounded by chance a hole in chance you can feel the clouds move over the sun from here you can hear the sun return and insect hum spray up you can lie still and feel this is the ultimate price you feel it getting paid by you it is you this gin heavy heaven blessed ground to think gay mean we bless the fake id the bouncer who knew this need to be needed to belong to know how a man taste full on vodka free of sin i know not which god to pray to i look to christ i look to every mouth on the dance floor i order a whiskey coke name it the blood of my new savior he is just he begs me to dance to marvel men with the dash of hips i brought he deems my mouth in some strangers mouth necessary bless that mans mouth the song we sway sloppy to the beat the bridge the length of his hand on my thigh back i know not which country i am of i want to live on his tongue build a home of gospel gayety i want to raise a city behind his teeth for all boys of choirs closets to refuge in i want my new god to look at the mecca i built him call it damn good or maybe im just tipsy free for the first time willing to worship anything i can taste summer road the ring around the lake we drove mostly in silence why arent i your wife you swerved around a turtle sunning itself i wanted to go back to hold the hot disc of it and place it in the grass we were late for dinner one twentieth of a mile an hour i said claws in tar you turned the car around traffic from the direction of the turtle and you saw before i did the fifty bones of the carapace crushed roman dome the surprise of red blood i couldnt help crying couldnt keep anything from harm im sorry you said and let it hurt the relief always of you in the seat beside me youll never know driving that road next winter you remembered that place in the road your turtle during hibernation a turtles heart beats once for every ten minutes it cannot voluntarily open its eyes being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require nor dare i chide the world without end hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do anything he thinks no ill master of the murmuring courts where the shapes of sleep convene lo my spirit here exhorts all the powers of thy demesne for their aid to woo my queen what reports yield thy jealous courts unseen vaporous unaccountable dreamland lies forlorn of light hollow like a breathing shell ah that from all dreams i might choose one dream and guide its flight i know well what her sleep should tell to night there the dreams are multitudes some that will not wait for sleep deep within the august woods some that hum while rest may steep weary labour laid a heap interludes some of grievous moods that weep poets fancies all are there there the elf girls flood with wings valleys full of plaintive air there breathe perfumes there in rings whirl the foam bewildered springs siren there winds her dizzy hair and sings thence the one dream mutually dreamed in bridal unison less than waking ecstasy half formed visions that make moan in the house of birth alone and what we at deaths wicket see unknown but for mine own sleep it lies in one gracious forms control fair with honourable eyes lamps of a translucent soul o their glance is loftiest dole sweet and wise wherein love descries his goal reft of her my dreams are all clammy trance that fears the sky changing footpaths shift and fall from polluted coverts nigh miserable phantoms sigh quakes the pall and the funeral goes by master is it soothly said that as echoes of mans speech far in secret clefts are made so do all mens bodies reach shadows oer thy sunken beach shape or shade in those halls pourtrayed of each ah might i by thy good grace groping in the windy stair darkness and the breath of space like loud waters everywhere meeting mine own image there face to face send it from that place to her nay not i but oh do thou master from thy shadowkind call my bodys phantom now bid it bear its face declind till its flight her slumbers find and her brow feel its presence bow like wind where in groves the gracile spring trembles with mute orison confidently strengthening waters voice and winds as one shed an echo in the sun soft as spring master bid it sing and moan song shall tell how glad and strong is the night she soothes alway moan shall grieve with that parched tongue of the brazen hours of day sounds as of the springtide they moan and song while the chill months long for may not the prayers which with all leave the worlds fluent woes prefer not the praise the world doth give dulcet fulsome whisperer let it yield my love to her and achieve strength that shall not grieve or err wheresoeer my dreams befall both at night watch let it say and where round the sundial the reluctant hours of day heartless hopeless of their way rest and call there her glance doth fall and stay suddenly her face is there so do mounting vapours wreathe subtle scented transports where the black firwood sets its teeth part the boughs and look beneath lilies share secret waters there and breathe master bid my shadow bend whispering thus till birth of light lest new shapes that sleep may send scatter all its work to flight master master of the night bid it spend speech song prayer and end aright yet ah me if at her head there another phantom lean murmuring oer the fragrant bed ah and if my spirits queen smile those alien prayers between ah poor shade shall it strive or fade unseen how should loves own messenger strive with love and be loves foe master nay if thus in her sleep a wedded heart should show silent let mine image go its old share of thy spell bound air to know like a vapour wan and mute like a flame so let it pass one low sigh across her lute one dull breath against her glass and to my sad soul alas one salute cold as when deaths foot shall pass then too let all hopes of mine all vain hopes by night and day slowly at thy summoning sign rise up pallid and obey dreams if this is thus were they be they thine and to dreamworld pine away yet from old time life not death master

lovers in the clutch of the chair you are a bloom of uncombed hair with a collection of roses bowls of mashed petals i make a clear cup of sky fold away clouds roll up blankets of blue i am a body of empty husks indian corn is in your hair the tassels the pollen fertility indelible ink is tattooing our lungs we speak smoke we exchange our lunacy for reverence respect tornados windy woman four winds we have extended the edge of expectation by merely living you have tallied compulsion into currency i am measured by the excitement my lips stir i am the bin for castoffs and the weary i wear my veil i have no children but you have many you dream of heaven and they all run up to meet you before the war leaned in and blew out the candles there were many long days where lovers called themselves lovers and a house was a dream but also four walls a roof a father called to his daughter to see the monarch butterflies pausing in their migration to fan the goldenrod a tiger in each coy disclosure a young man reached for a blackberry and found draped on a branch a green snake the color of matcha a snake the color of matcha sighed in the sun people drove in cars there were jobs and someone had to work every morning a man quit his job but it was no tragedy he didnt like the work another man slid in and found it comfortable enough and just as easily slid in beside the mans wife and into the everyday rhythms of his life and that was no tragedy either after rains a ring of mushrooms would delicately crack the earth spanish moss harbored red mites the sky wasnt interesting no one looked up whoever comes to shroud me do not harm nor question much that subtle wreath of hair which crowns my arm the mystery the sign you must not touch for tis my outward soul viceroy to that which then to heaven being gone will leave this to control and keep these limbs her provinces from dissolution for if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall through every part can tie those parts and make me one of all those hairs which upward grew and strength and art have from a better brain can better doit except she meant that i by this should know my pain as prisoners then are manacled when theyare condemnd to die whateer she meant byit bury it with me for since i am loves martyr it might breed idolatry if into other hands these relics came as twas humility to afford to it all that a soul can do so tis some bravery that since you would have none of me i bury some of you men call you fair and you do credit it for that your self ye daily such do see but the true fair that is the gentle wit and vertuous mind is much more praisd of me for all the rest how ever fair it be shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue but only that is permanent and free from frail corruption that doth flesh ensue that is true beauty that doth argue you to be divine and born of heavenly seed derivd from that fair spirit from whom all true and perfect beauty did at first proceed he only fair and what he fair hath made all other fair like flowers untimely fade didnt i stand there once white knuckled gripping the just lit taper swearing id never go back and hadnt you kissed the rain from my mouth and werent we gentle and awed and afraid knowing wed stepped from the room of desire into the further room of love and wasnt it sacred the sweetness we licked from each others hands and were we not lovely then were we not as lovely as thunder and damp grass and flame how do you know if its love she asks and i think if you have to ask its not but i know this wont help i want to say youre too young to worry about it as if she has questions about medicare or social security but this wont help either youll just know is a lie and one truth when you still want to be with them the next morning would involve too many follow up questions the difficulty with love i want to say is sometimes you only know afterwards that its arrived or left love is the elephant and we are the blind mice unable to understand the whole i want to say love is this desire to help even when i know i cant just as i couldnt explain electricity stars the color of the sky baldness tornadoes fingernails coconuts or the other things she has asked about over the years all those phenomena whose daily existence seems miraculous instead i shake my head i dont even know how to match my socks go ask your mother she laughs and says i did mom told me to come and ask you when from my counted days i think of times still owed to me by tyrant love and my temples anticipate a frost beyond the tribulation of my years i see loves counterfeit joys are a poison reason sips from a glass raised to those for whom hunger dare appear in the guise of my honeyed daydream what potion of forgetting pleases reason that by neglect of its duty so toils against itself for satisfaction but my affliction seeks solace measure of the desire to be remedied and the desire to overcome it loves remedy cuando imagino de mis breves d as los

del remedio indicio y el remedio de amor querer vencelle lope de vega i have led her home my love my only friend there is none like her none and never yet so warmly ran my blood and sweetly on and on calming itself to the long wished for end full to the banks close on the promised good none like her none just now the dry tongued laurels pattering talk seemd her light foot along the garden walk and shook my heart to think she comes once more but even then i heard her close the door the gates of heaven are closed and she is gone there is none like her none nor will be when our summers have deceased o art thou sighing for lebanon in the long breeze that streams to thy delicious east sighing for lebanon dark cedar tho thy limbs have here increased upon a pastoral slope as fair and looking to the south and fed with honeyed rain and delicate air and haunted by the starry head of her whose gentle will has changed my fate and made my life a perfumed altar frame and over whom thy darkness must have spread with such delight as theirs of old thy great forefathers of the thornless garden there shadowing the snow limbed eve from whom she came here will i lie while these long branches sway and you fair stars that crown a happy day go in and out as if at merry play who am no more so all forlorn as when it seemed far better to be born to labour and the mattock hardened hand than nursed at ease and brought to understand a sad astrology the boundless plan that makes you tyrants in your iron skies innumerable pitiless passionless eyes cold fires yet with power to burn and brand his nothingness into man but now shine on and what care i who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl the countercharm of space and hollow sky and do accept my madness and would die to save from some slight shame one simple girl would die for sullen seeming death may give more life to love than is or ever was in our low world where yet tis sweet to live let no one ask me how it came to pass it seems that i am happy that to me a livelier emerald twinkles in the grass a purer sapphire melts into the sea not die but live a life of truest breath and teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs oh why should love like men in drinking songs spice his fair banquet with the dust of death make answer maud my bliss maud made my maud by that long loving kiss life of my life wilt thou not answer this the dusky strand of death inwoven here with dear loves tie makes love himself more dear is that enchanted moan only the swell of the long waves that roll in yonder bay and hark the clock within the silver knell of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white and die to live long as my pulses play but now by this my love has closed her sight and given false death her hand and stoln away to dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell among the fragments of the golden day may nothing there her maiden grace affright dear heart i feel with thee the drowsy spell my bride to be my evermore delight my own hearts heart my ownest own farewell it is but for a little space i go and ye meanwhile far over moor and fell beat to the noiseless music of the night has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow of your soft splendour that you look so bright i have climbed nearer out of lonely hell beat happy stars timing with things below beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell blest but for some dark undercurrent woe that seems to draw but it shall not be so let all be well be well my transgressions pile against the garden wall built when rome began to weaken scarred by a cannonball i gossiped i snubbed a dinner guest i watch until the wall writhes with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows and the odd librarian ive begun to be depleted by your absence one of loves worst symptoms for years id had the sense to hold myself apart ive been here long enough to kill two mint plants and a lavender then resurrect their better part id like to let you die on the vine not you the you i dream who follows through on waking see how the watcher sees the storm but doesnt get wet be that be what be wiser than the heart come o come my lifes delight let me not in languor pine love loves no delay thy sight the more enjoyed the more divine o come and take from me the pain of being deprived of thee thou all sweetness dost enclose like a little world of bliss beauty guards thy looks the rose in them pure and eternal is come then and make thy flight as swift to me as heavenly light focus on the taxidermied light the quarked vehemence of splayed negation to rags your britches seeping glib intent sight catastrophic given to seizures the curlicue scent has not the mother in it the fall of romance the hold of the tender new programs aloft every nerve to shudder ghosting monitions of the incomplete either will the aching swells apart from bliss coordinates of favor hip neath fiber strip follicle sheath of slip chord parent display sensitized gift wagon fern entrenched the halo of the nation is the caul throated blood of hench rosellad to the peak of taxonomied childless where your mottled hologram the feathered monster of the throttled quizzical with the world am to console the hope for saplings edifice disjunction the dissociated fanfare of motivated loss entrees the ingredient of dining undertaken your teeth the grinder your lips the sensitive house the beds laments the reindeers horses dreams in halves cameod sighs sleepless in the cold dark i look through the closed dim door be fore me which be comes an abyss into which my memories have fallen past laughter or horror passion or hard work my memories of our past laughter horror passion hard work an ache of be ing an ache of being over love an ache of being over love like projections on the screen of the heavy window curtains flashing lights of a slow scraping after midnight snowplow for a moment pulse in this room you flinch something flickers not fleeing your face my heart hammers at the ceiling telling my tongue to turn it down too late the something climbs leaps is falling now across us like the prank of an icy brainy lord i chose the wrong word i am wrong for not choosing merely to smile to pull you toward me and away from what you think of as that other me who wanders lost among among whom the many the rare i wish you didnt care i watch you watching her her very shadow is a rage that trashes the rooms of your eyes do you claim surprise at what she wants the poor girl pelted with despair who flits from grief to grief isnt it you she seeks and if you blame her know that she blames you for choosing not her but me love is never fair but do we should we care in love his grammar grew rich with intensifiers and adverbs fellmadly from the sky like pheasants for the peasantry and he as satedas they were lolled under shade treesuntil roused by moonlight and the beautiful fraternal twins and and but oh that was whenhe knew he couldnt resista conjunction of any kind one said accumulate the otherwas a doubter who loved the windand the mind that cleans up after it for lovehe wanted to break all the rules light a candle behind a sentencenamed sheila always running onand wishing to be stoppedby the hard button of a period sometimes in desperation hed looktoward a mannequin or a window dresserwith a penchant for parsing but mostly he wanted you sheila and the adjectives that could precedeand change you bluesy fly by night queen of all that is and might be let it come down these thicknesses of airhave long enough walled love away from love stillness has hardened until words despairof their high leaps and kisses shut themselvesback into wishing crippled lovers lieagainst a weather which holds out on them waiting awaiting some shrill sign some cry some screaming cat that smells a sacrificeand spells them thunder start the mumbling lips syllable by monotonous syllable that wash away the sullen griefs of loveand drown out knowledge of an ancient war o ill willed dark give with the sound of rain let love be brought to ignorance again originally appeared in the march issue of poetry magazine but do not let us quarrel any more no my lucrezia bear with me for once sit down and all shall happen as you wish you turn your face but does it bring your heart ill work then for your friends friend never fear treat his own subject after his own way fix his own time accept too his own price and shut the money into this small hand when next it takes mine will it tenderly oh ill content him but to morrow love i often am much wearier than you think this evening more than usual and it seems as if forgive now should you let me sit here by the window with your hand in mine and look a half hour forth on fiesole both of one mind as married people use quietly quietly the evening through i might get up to morrow to my work cheerful and fresh as ever let us try to morrow how you shall be glad for this your soft hand is a woman of itself and mine the mans bared breast she curls inside dont count the time lost neither you must serve for each of the five pictures we require it saves a model so keep looking so my serpentining beauty rounds on rounds how could you ever prick those perfect ears even to put the pearl there oh so sweet my face my moon my everybodys moon which everybody looks on and calls his and i suppose is looked on by in turn while she looks no ones very dear no less you smile why theres my picture ready made theres what we painters call our harmony a common greyness silvers everything all in a twilight you and i alike you at the point of your first pride in me thats gone you know but i at every point my youth my hope my art being all toned down to yonder sober pleasant fiesole theres the bell clinking from the chapel top that length of convent wall across the way holds the trees safer huddled more inside the last monk leaves the garden days decrease and autumn grows autumn in everything eh the whole seems to fall into a shape as if i saw alike my work and self and all that i was born to be and do a twilight piece love we are in gods hand how strange now looks the life he makes us lead so free we seem so fettered fast we are i feel he laid the fetter let it lie this chamber for example turn your head all thats behind us you dont understand nor care to understand about my art but you can hear at least when people speak and that cartoon the second from the door it is the thing love so such things should be behold madonna i am bold to say i can do with my pencil what i know what i see what at bottom of my heart i wish for if i ever wish so deep do easily too when i say perfectly i do not boast perhaps yourself are judge who listened to the legates talk last week and just as much they used to say in france at any rate tis easy all of it no sketches first no studies thats long past i do what many dream of all their lives dream strive to do and agonize to do and fail in doing i could count twenty such on twice your fingers and not leave this town who strive you dont know how the others strive to paint a little thing like that you smeared carelessly passing with your robes afloat yet do much less so much less someone says i know his name no matter so much less well less is more lucrezia i am judged there burns a truer light of god in them in their vexed beating stuffed and stopped up brain heart or whateer else than goes on to prompt this low pulsed forthright craftsmans hand of mine their works drop groundward but themselves i know reach many a time a heaven thats shut to me enter and take their place there sure enough though they come back and cannot tell the world my works are nearer heaven but i sit here the sudden blood of these men at a word praise them it boils or blame them it boils too i painting from myself and to myself know what i do am unmoved by mens blame or their praise either somebody remarks morellos outline there is wrongly traced his hue mistaken what of that or else rightly traced and well ordered what of that speak as they please what does the mountain care ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for all is silver grey placid and perfect with my art the worse i know both what i want and what might gain and yet how profitless to know to sigh had i been two another and myself our head would have oerlooked the world no doubt yonders a work now of that famous youth the urbinate who died five years ago tis copied george vasari sent it me well i can fancy how he did it all pouring his soul with kings and popes to see reaching that heaven might so replenish him above and through his art for it gives way that arm is wrongly put and there again a fault to pardon in the drawings lines its body so to speak its soul is right he means right that a child may understand still what an arm and i could alter it but all the play the insight and the stretch out of me out of me and wherefore out had you enjoined them on me given me soul we might have risen to rafael i and you nay love you did give all i asked i think more than i merit yes by many times but had you oh with the same perfect brow and perfect eyes and more than perfect mouth and the low voice my soul hears as a bird the fowlers pipe and follows to the snare had you with these the same but brought a mind some women do so had the mouth there urged god and the glory never care for gain the present by the future what is that live for fame side by side with agnolo rafael is waiting up to god all three i might have done it for you so it seems perhaps not all is as god over rules beside incentives come from the souls self the rest avail not why do i need you what wife had rafael or has agnolo in this world who can do a thing will not and who would do it cannot i perceive yet the wills somewhat somewhat too the power and thus we half men struggle at the end god i conclude compensates punishes tis safer for me if the award be strict that i am something underrated here poor this long while despised to speak the truth i dared not do you know leave home all day for fear of chancing on the paris lords the best is when they pass and look aside but they speak sometimes i must bear it all well may they speak that francis that first time and that long festal year at fontainebleau i surely then could sometimes leave the ground put on the glory rafaels daily wear in that humane great monarchs golden look one finger in his beard or twisted curl over his mouths good mark that made the smile one arm about my shoulder round my neck the jingle of his gold chain in my ear i painting proudly with his breath on me all his court round him seeing with his eyes such frank french eyes and such a fire of souls profuse my hand kept plying by those hearts and best of all this this this face beyond this in the background waiting on my work to crown the issue with a last reward a good time was it not my kingly days and had you not grown restless but i know tis done and past twas right my instinct said too live the life grew golden and not grey and im the weak eyed bat no sun should tempt out of the grange whose four walls make his world how could it end in any other way you called me and i came home to your heart the triumph was to reach and stay there since i reached it ere the triumph what is lost let my hands frame your face in your hairs gold you beautiful lucrezia that are mine rafael did this andrea painted that the romans is the better when you pray but still the others virgin was his wife men will excuse me i am glad to judge both pictures in your presence clearer grows my better fortune i resolve to think for do you know lucrezia as god lives said one day agnolo his very self to rafael i have known it all these years when the young man was flaming out his thoughts upon a palace wall for rome to see too lifted up in heart because of it friend theres a certain sorry little scrub goes up and down our florence none cares how who were he set to plan and execute as you are pricked on by your popes and kings would bring the sweat into that brow of yours to rafaels and indeed the arm is wrong i hardly dare yet only you to see give the chalk here quick thus the line should go ay but the soul hes rafael rub it out still all i care for if he spoke the truth what he why who but michel agnolo do you forget already words like those if really there was such a chance so lost is whether youre not grateful but more pleased well let me think so and you smile indeed this hour has been an hour another smile if you would sit thus by me every night i should work better do you comprehend i mean that i should earn more give you more see it is settled dusk now theres a star morellos gone the watch lights show the wall the cue owls speak the name we call them by come from the window love come in at last inside the melancholy little house we built to be so gay with god is just king francis may forgive me oft at nights when i look up from painting eyes tired out the walls become illumined brick from brick distinct instead of mortar fierce bright gold that gold of his i did cement them with let us but love each other must you go that cousin here again he waits outside must see you you and not with me those loans more gaming debts to pay you smiled for that well let smiles buy me have you more to spend while hand and eye and something of a heart are left me works my ware and whats it worth ill pay my fancy only let me sit the grey remainder of the evening out idle you call it and muse perfectly how i could paint were i but back in france one picture just one more the virgins face not yours this time i want you at my side to hear them that is michel agnolo judge all i do and tell you of its worth will you to morrow satisfy your friend i take the subjects for his corridor finish the portrait out of hand there there and throw him in another thing or two if he demurs the whole should prove enough to pay for this same cousins freak beside whats better and whats all i care about get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff love does that please you ah but what does he the cousin what does he to please you more i am grown peaceful as old age to night i regret little i would change still less since there my past life lies why alter it the very wrong to francis it is true i took his coin was tempted and complied and built this house and sinned and all is said my father and my mother died of want well had i riches of my own you see how one gets rich let each one bear his lot they were born poor lived poor and poor they died and i have laboured somewhat in my time and not been paid profusely some good son paint my two hundred pictures let him try no doubt theres something strikes a balance yes you loved me quite enough it seems to night this must suffice me here what would one have in heaven perhaps new chances one more chance four great walls in the new jerusalem meted on each side by the angels reed for leonard rafael agnolo and me to cover the three first without a wife while i have mine so still they overcome because theres still lucrezia as i choose again the cousins whistle go my love i shall not go with pain whether you hold me whether you forget my little loss and my immortal gain o flower unseen o fountain sealed apart give me one look one look remembering yet sweet heart i shall not go with grief whether you call me whether you deny the crowning vintage and the golden sheaf o april hopes that blossom but to close give me one look one look and so good bye red rose i shall not go with sighs but as full crowned the warrior leaves the fight dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes o life so bitter sweet and heaven so far give me one look one look and so good night my star it is the millers daughter and she is grown so dear so dear that i would be the jewel that trembles at her ear for hid in ringlets day and night id touch her neck so warm and white and i would be the girdle about her dainty dainty waist and her heart would beat against me in sorrow and in rest and i should know if it beat right id clasp it round so close and tight and i would be the necklace and all day long to fall and rise upon her balmy bosom with her laughter or her sighs and i would lie so light so light i scarce should be unclasped at night now that i tying thy glass mask tightly may gaze thro these faint smokes curling whitely as thou pliest thy trade in this devils smithy which is the poison to poison her prithee he is with her and they know that i know where they are what they do they believe my tears flow while they laugh laugh at me at me fled to the drear empty church to pray god in for them i am here grind away moisten and mash up thy paste pound at thy powder i am not in haste better sit thus and observe thy strange things than go where men wait me and dance at the kings that in the mortar you call it a gum ah the brave tree whence such gold oozings come and yonder soft phial the exquisite blue sure to taste sweetly is that poison too had i but all of them thee and thy treasures what a wild crowd of invisible pleasures to carry pure death in an earring a casket a signet a fan mount a filigree basket soon at the kings a mere lozenge to give and pauline should have just thirty minutes to live but to light a pastile and elise with her head and her breast and her arms and her hands should drop dead quick is it finished the colours too grim why not soft like the phials enticing and dim let it brighten her drink let her turn it and stir and try it and taste ere she fix and prefer what a drop shes not little no minion like me thats why she ensnared him this never will free the soul from those masculine eyes say no to that pulses magnificent come and go for only last night as they whispered i brought my own eyes to bear on her so that i thought could i keep them one half minute fixed she would fall shrivelled she fell not yet this does it all not that i bid you spare her the pain let death be felt and the proof remain brand burn up bite into its grace he is sure to remember her dying face is it done take my mask off nay be not morose it kills her and this prevents seeing it close the delicate droplet my whole fortunes fee if it hurts her beside can it ever hurt me now take all my jewels gorge gold to your fill you may kiss me old man on my mouth if you will but brush this dust off me lest horror it brings ere i know it next moment i dance at the kings it seemed as if we did not sleep one wink that night i was sighing deep the cruellest judge in the costliest court could not condemn a night so short we had the light out but i know each time i turned a radiant glow suffused the room and shining snow alit from heavens candle fires illuminated our desires but the last time i held her strong excited closest very long something started to go wrong the edge of dawns despotic veil showed at the eastern window pale and there it was the morning light gwen was seized with a fearful fright became an apparition cried get up go now with god go hide love is a salt a gall a rue a vinegar vintage dos y ddw vaya con dios quickly too ah not yet never yet my love the stars and moon still shine above then why do the raucous ravens talk with such a loud insistent squawk crows always cry like that when fleas nibble their ankles nip their knees and why do the dogs yip yammer yell they think theyve caught a foxs smell poet the wisdom of a fool offers poor counsel as a rule open the door open it wide as fast as you can and leap outside the dogs are fierce when they get untied the woods are only a bound from here and i can outjump a deer my dear but tell me best beloved of men will you come again will you come again gwen you know im your nightingale and ill be with you without fail when the cloud is cloak and the dark is sky and when the night comes so will i if i could catch the green lantern of the firefly i could see to write you a letter wild nights wild nights were i with thee wild nights should be our luxury futile the winds to a heart in port done with the compass done with the chart rowing in eden ah the sea might i but moor tonight in thee the bugle sounds the measured call to prayers the band starts bravely with a clarion hymn from every side singly in groups in pairs each to his kind of service comes to worship him our faces washed our hearts in the right place we kneel or stand or listen from our tents half naked natives with their kind of grace move down the road with balanced staffs like mendicants and over the hill the guns bang like a door and planes repeat their mission in the heights the jungle outmaneuvers creeping war and crawls within the circle of our sacred rites i long for our disheveled sundays home breakfast the comics news of latest crimes talk without reference and palindromes sleep and the philharmonic and the ponderous times i long for lounging in the afternoons of clean intelligent warmth my brothers mind books and thin plates and flowers and shining spoons and your loves presence snowy beautiful and kind my heart was suspect wired to an ekg i walked a treadmill that measured my ebb and flow tracked isotopes that ploughed my veins looked for a constancy ive hardly ever found for a month i worried as i climbed the stairs to my office the mortality i never believed in was here now they say my hearts ok just high cholesterol but i know my hearts a house someone has broken into a room you come back to and know some stranger with bad intent has been there and touched all that you love you know he can come back its his call his house now summoned by conscious recollection she would be smiling they might be in a kitchen talking before or after dinner but they are in this other room the window has many small panes and they are on a couch embracing he holds her as tightly as he can she buries herself in his body morning maybe it is evening light is flowing through the room outside the day is slowly succeeded by night succeeded by day the process wobbles wildly and accelerates weeks months years the light in the room does not change so it is plain what is happening they are trying to become one creature and something will not have it they are tender with each other afraid their brief sharp cries will reconcile them to the moment when they fall away again so they rub against each other their mouths dry then wet then dry they feel themselves at the center of a powerful and baffled will they feel they are an almost animal washed up on the shore of a world or huddled against the gate of a garden to which they cant admit they can never be admitted you ask me what since we must part you shall bring back to me bring back a pure and faithful heart as true as mine to thee you talk of gems from foreign lands of treasure spoil and prize ah love i shall not search your hands but look into your eyes surprised by joy impatient as the wind i turned to share the transport oh with whom but thee long buried in the silent tomb that spot which no vicissitude can find love faithful love recalled thee to my mind but how could i forget thee through what power even for the least division of an hour have i been so beguiled as to be blind to my most grievous loss that thoughts return was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore save one one only when i stood forlorn knowing my hearts best treasure was no more that neither present time nor years unborn could to my sight that heavenly face restore i follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle under your shoulder lean over your back breathing into your hair and thinking of nothing i want to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop and drift away from all of it our two cars rusting in the parking lot our families whining like tame geese at feeding time and all the bosses of the earth cursing the traffic in the morning haze they will telephone each other from their sofas and glass desks with no idea where we could be unable to picture the dark throat of the saxophone playing upriver or the fire we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light having stolen a truckload of roses and thrown them into the sea on the metro i have to ask a young woman to move the packages beside her to make room for me shes reading her foot propped on the seat in front of her and barely looks up as she pulls them to her i sit take out my own book cioran the temptation to exist and notice her glancing up from hers to take in the title of mine and then as gombrowicz puts it she affirms herself physically that is becomes present in a way she hadnt been before though she hasnt moved shes allowed herself to come more sharply into focus be more accessible to my sensual perception so i cant help but remark her strong figure and very tan skin how literally golden young women can look at the end of summer she leans back now and as the train rocks and her arm brushes mine she doesnt pull it away she seems to be allowing our surfaces to unite the fine hairs on both our forearms sensitive alive achingly alive bring news of someone touched someone sensed and thus acknowledged known i understand that in no way is she offering more than this and in truth i have no desire for more but its still enough for me to be taken by a surge first of warmth then of something like its opposite a memory a girl id mooned for from afar across the table from me in the library in school now our feet i thought touching touching even again and then with all i craved that touch to mean my having to realize it wasnt her flesh my flesh for that gleaming time had pressed but a table leg the young woman today removes her arm now stands swaying against the lurch of the slowing train and crossing before me brushes my knee and does that thing again asserts her bodily being again gombrowicz again then quickly moves to the door of the car and descends not once looking back to my relief not looking back and i allow myself the thought that though i must be to her again as senseless as that table of my youth as wooden as unfeeling perhaps there was a moment i was not when from the world i shall be tane and from earths necessary paine then let no blacks be worne for me not in a ring my dear by thee but this bright diamond let it be worn in remembrance of me and when it sparkles in your eye think tis my shadow passeth by for why more bright you shall me see then that or any gem can bee dress not the house with sable weed as if there was some dismal deed acted to be when i am gone there is no cause for me to mourn and let no badge of herald be the sign of my antiquity it was my glory i did spring from heavens eternall powerful king to his bright palace heir am i it is his promise heel not lye by my dear brother lay me it was a promise made by thee and now i must bid thee adieu for ime a parting now from you once i loved a spider when i was born a fly a velvet footed spider with a gown of rainbow dye she ate my wings and gloated she bound me with a hair she drove me to her parlor above her winding stair to educate young spiders she took me all apart my ghost came back to haunt her i saw her eat my heart the trouble with paradise is you never want to be away from home i make what calls me out all gone before you know it words may drop passing color yet seeing you here now are born again and again closing a word in the mouth feels the sound until the tongue cant stay still to unmask is to go silent language makes no promise to communicate an articulated sound has its own dream in the ear her presence in the room gives aroma to the syllables i voice now shes ready to draw eros from foreign bodies it starts by focusing on the sounds beyond hearing still felt by she i mean who speaking animate configures this is the time of alternative obscurities to see through through thoroughly as a word weighs good heavn i thank thee since it was designed i should be framed but of the weaker kind that yet my soul is rescued from the love of all those trifles which their passions move pleasures and praise and plenty have with me but their just value if allowed they be freely and thankfully as much i taste as will not reason or religion waste if theyre denied i on my self can live and slight those aids unequal chance does give when in the sun my wings can be displayed and in retirement i can bless the shade language must suffice years ago under a sweet june sky stung with stars and swept back by black leaves barely rustling a beautiful woman nearly killed me listen she said and turned her lovely face to the stars the wild sky no no years ago under a sweet june sky strung with stars and swept back by black leaves barely rustling under this sky broad bright all rung around with rustling elders or intoxicating willows or oaks i forget under this sky a beautiful woman killed me nearly i say beautiful you had to see her listen she said and turned a lovely shell of her ear to the swirl of stars and the moon smudged as a wingtip in one tree not far yes she scraped my back bloody against a rough trunk yes she flung back her lovely face and her hair holding me down and the tree shook slowly as in a mild persistent laugh or wind and the moon high in that black tree swung to and fro there were millions of stars up where she stared past us and one moon i think excuse me my friend who loves poetry truly says too much nature taints my work yes yes yes too many birds stars too much rain too much grass so many wild bowing limbs howling or groaning into the natural night and he might be right even here that is if tree were a tree that is if star or moon or even beautiful womancraning the shell of her ear were what they were they are i think not no and a poem about nature contains anything but when they descended to us they were a cloud of stars sweeping lightly they sang to us urgently about our lives they touched us with a hundred thousand hair soft small legs and held down by such hungers we let them cover us this beautiful woman this me who couldnt move who were stung do you hear who were stung again were covered that quickly crying to each other to fly away i just cant erase the exquisite weeping language of the wasps nor her face in starlight and so tranquil under that false papery bobbing moon just minutes before saying listen listen nor then the weight of her whole natural body pinning down mine until we both cried out for fear and pain and still couldnt move language must suffice first it doesnt then of course it does listen listen what do you hear this nearly killed me ill never know why she didnt just whisper here they come warn move cry theyll kill us yes i will save you yes i love you too much to watch you suffer but its all i recall or now need and anyway i loved her she was so beautiful and that is what i have had to say before its too late before they have killed me before they have killed you too or before we have all become something else entirely which is to say before we are only language i love you he wouldnt say it was against his philosophy i love you didnt mean what it meant plus the verray construction of the phrase caused bad old concrete lawman vandal verbal mildew upon the grape harvest and war for rare minerals required to manufacture commu nications devices damage saying i love you damaged love subject and object plus he could prove this in two dense and delphic languages suitable for philosophy opera cursing and racking the nerves of arti ficial intelligence machines that perhaps could love but would be hard wired giammai to dare say so so what moved him to not say i love you what wake up and spoil the coffee ashtray licking djinn i have to start to agree the verbness of it impropriety eyes glob up the syringe when youre giving blood semisolid spiralling perhaps too active i love you i sand you i drill you i honey and set you for wasps crimson you like a stolen toga add value applying dye fight owner ship i cite you to justify skilled outrage put your name as guarantor on an astronomical mortgage i admit desertification comes as a relief from i to o o my oasis o my mirage maybe the verb is a tending to wards a tightrope a tropism a station but thats meeting him on his own ground plus i cant disprove entire languages plus those three little words arent meant as saying an icy drink in stormlight a looked at leaf left to transpire its own way until and sans i love you the centuried moon rose above dinnermint stone many men contin ued talking a woman lifted her sarsenet skirt peed on green lilies and utterly gracious walked through the archway to join the mixed group delighting in word believe it fresh air book i a thing of beauty is a joy for ever its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness but still will keep a bower quiet for us and a sleep full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing therefore on every morrow are we wreathing a flowery band to bind us to the earth spite of despondence of the inhuman dearth of noble natures of the gloomy days of all the unhealthy and oer darkened ways made for our searching yes in spite of all some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits such the sun the moon trees old and young sprouting a shady boon for simple sheep and such are daffodils with the green world they live in and clear rills that for themselves a cooling covert make gainst the hot season the mid forest brake rich with a sprinkling of fair musk rose blooms and such too is the grandeur of the dooms we have imagined for the mighty dead all lovely tales that we have heard or read an endless fountain of immortal drink pouring unto us from the heavens brink nor do we merely feel these essences for one short hour no even as the trees that whisper round a temple become soon dear as the temples self so does the moon the passion poesy glories infinite haunt us till they become a cheering light unto our souls and bound to us so fast that whether there be shine or gloom oercast they always must be with us or we die therefore tis with full happiness that i will trace the story of endymion the very music of the name has gone into my being and each pleasant scene is growing fresh before me as the green of our own valleys so i will begin now while i cannot hear the citys din now while the early budders are just new and run in mazes of the youngest hue about old forests while the willow trails its delicate amber and the dairy pails bring home increase of milk and as the year grows lush in juicy stalks ill smoothly steer my little boat for many quiet hours with streams that deepen freshly into bowers many and many a verse i hope to write before the daisies vermeil rimmd and white hide in deep herbage and ere yet the bees hum about globes of clover and sweet peas i must be near the middle of my story o may no wintry season bare and hoary see it half finishd but let autumn bold with universal tinge of sober gold be all about me when i make an end and now at once adventuresome i send my herald thought into a wilderness there let its trumpet blow and quickly dress my uncertain path with green that i may speed easily onward thorough flowers and weed the grasses are light brown and the ocean comes in long shimmering lines under the fleet from last night which dozes now in the early morning here and there horses graze on somebodys acreage strangely it was not my desire that bade me speak in church to be released but memory of the way it used to be in careless and exotic play when characters were promises then recognitions the world of transformation is real and not real but trusting enough of these lessons i mean didactic phrases to take you in and out of loves mysterious bonds well i myself am not myself and which power of survival i speak for is not made of houses it is inner luxury of golden figures that breathe like mountains do and whose skin is made dusky by stars i blush quicker than a school of blue jack mackerel arranging itself into an orb of dazzle to avoid nips and gulps from the dolphins whove been silently trailing them waiting for them to relax when i hear her growl her scratch thirst and giggle when she drops swear words pressed to wax i cant even look him in the eye when i ask him to give it a good listen with me but he does ever patient and we both get a light bless of sweat on a bright address that still maps us to each other after all this time when i read him the lyrics the pink of my cheeks is like the pink of an orchid mantis just when you least expect it the pretend flower will reach out and snatch a butterfly from the air when i say flower i mean how her song blooms in the cicada electric mississippi night when i say pink i mean nectar i mean a long kiss good and sweet flow gently sweet afton among thy green braes flow gently ill sing thee a song in thy praise my marys asleep by thy murmuring stream flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream thou stock dove whose echo resounds thro the glen ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den thou green crested lapwing thy screaming forbear i charge you disturb not my slumbering fair how lofty sweet afton thy neighbouring hills far markd with the courses of clear winding rills there daily i wander as noon rises high my flocks and my marys sweet cot in my eye how pleasant thy banks and green valleys below where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow there oft as mild evning sweeps over the lea the sweet scented birk shades my mary and me thy crystal stream afton how lovely it glides and winds by the cot where my mary resides how wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave as gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave flow gently sweet afton among thy green braes flow gently sweet river the theme of my lays my marys asleep by thy murmuring stream flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream for gods sake hold your tongue and let me love or chide my palsy or my gout my five gray hairs or ruined fortune flout with wealth your state your mind with arts improve take you a course get you a place observe his honor or his grace or the kings real or his stamp d face contemplate what you will approve so you will let me love alas alas whos injured by my love what merchants ships have my sighs drowned who says my tears have overflowed his ground when did my colds a forward spring remove when did the heats which my veins fill add one more to the plaguy bill soldiers find wars and lawyers find out still litigious men which quarrels move though she and i do love call us what you will we are made such by love call her one me another fly were tapers too and at our own cost die and we in us find the eagle and the dove the ph nix riddle hath more wit by us we two being one are it so to one neutral thing both sexes fit we die and rise the same and prove mysterious by this love we can die by it if not live by love and if unfit for tombs and hearseour legend be it will be fit for verse and if no piece of chronicle we prove well build in sonnets pretty rooms as well a well wrought urn becomesthe greatest ashes as half acre tombs and by these hymns all shall approve us canonized for love and thus invoke us you whom reverend love made one anothers hermitage you to whom love was peace that now is rage who did the whole worlds soul contract and drove into the glasses of your eyes so made such mirrors and such spies that they did all to you epitomize countries towns courts beg from above a pattern of your love my puppet strings are the sweet decaying lamps i flutter round i am as immense as a black kid with a spinning top drowned tripper fat crawls into hollow cuffs to be sewn up like hot cats cracked soft caryatids in tails ill force you all to your knees your dirty muzzles will squawk out of your faces and i will continue to climb ill spread my thin arms along the queer walls till they bleed ill reach into threadbare velvet so that you bash yourselves like poor moths on corners of night the reason im here is to scratch all the white bellies squatting down there your stupid silence i will just toss up in the air i am as sky high as all your staring regards laid end to end on the ground somewhere lies my broken smile if all the world and love were young and truth in every shepherds tongue these pretty pleasures might me move to live with thee and be thy love time drives the flocks from field to fold when rivers rage and rocks grow cold and philomel becometh dumb the rest complains of cares to come the flowers do fade and wanton fields to wayward winter reckoning yields a honey tongue a heart of gall is fancys spring but sorrows fall thy gowns thy shoes thy beds of roses thy cap thy kirtle and thy posies soon break soon wither soon forgotten in folly ripe in reason rotten thy belt of straw and ivy buds the coral clasps and amber studs all these in me no means can move to come to thee and be thy love but could youth last and love still breed had joys no date nor age no need then these delights my mind might move to live with thee and be thy love about twenty years ago two girls came in where i worked a bosomy english rose and her friend in specs i could talk to faces in those days sparked the whole shooting match off and i doubt if ever one had like hers but it was the friend i took out and in seven years after that wrote over four hundred letters gave a ten guinea ring i got back in the end and met at numerous cathedral cities unknown to the clergy i believe i met beautiful twice she was trying both times so i thought not to laugh parting after about five rehearsals was an agreement that i was too selfish withdrawn and easily bored to love well useful to get that learnt in my wallet are still two snaps of bosomy rose with fur gloves on unlucky charms perhaps last night i traced with my finger the long scar on my loves stomach as if i was following a road on a map i heard the scream of tires saw the flash of chrome her six year old body a rag doll bleeding at the seams it is foolish of me to wish i was there before it happened to reach back thirty years clasp her small hand and pull her away from that speeding car that turned her organs into bruised fruit how easily she could have missed her seventh birthday the lit candles waiting for her to blow out their tiny flames how easily i couldve spent last night in a crowded bar instead my shoulders brushing against strangers a man on the jukebox singing his heart out to a woman with the prettiest eyes hes ever seen holy father i cant pretend im not afraid to see you again but ill say that when the time comes i believe my courage will expand like a sponge cowboy in water my earth father was far braver than me coming to america he knew no english save rolling stones lyrics and how to say thanks god will his goodness roll over to my tab and if yes how soon im sorry for neglecting your myriad signs which seem obvious now as a hawks head on an empty plate i keep waking up at the bottom of swimming pools the water reflecting whatever i miss most whiskey glass pill bottles my mothers oleander which was sweet and evergreen but toxic in all its parts i know it was silly to keep what i kept from you youve always been so charmed by my weaknesses i just figured you were becoming fed up with all your making like a virtuoso trying not to smash apart her flute onstage plus my sins were practically devotional two peaches stolen from a bodega which were so sweet i savored even the bits i flossed out my teeth i know its no excuse but even thinking about them now im drooling consider the night i spent reading another mans lover the dream songs in bed we made it to a green living drops limply before we were tangled into each other cat still sleeping at our feet allow me these treasures lord time will break what doesnt bend even time even you stranger you who hide my love in the curved cheek of a smile and sleep with her upon a tongue of soft lies that beguile your paradisal ecstasy is justified is justified by hunger of the beasts beneath the overhanging cloud who to snatch quick pleasures run before their momentary sun be eclipsed by death lightly lightly from my sleep she stole our vows of dew to break upon a day of melting rain another love to take her happy happy perfidy was justified was justified since compulsive needs of sense clamour to be satisfied and she was never one to miss plausible happiness of a new experience i who stand beneath a bitter blasted tree with the green life of summer joy cut from my side by that self justifying knife in my exiled misery were justified were justified if upon two lives i preyed or punished with my suicide or murdered pity in my heart or two other lives did part to make the world pay what i paid oh but supposing that i climb alone to a high room of clouds up a ladder of the time and lie upon a bed alone and tear a feather from a wing and listen to the world below and write round my high paper walls anything and everything which i know and do not know what is it men in women do require the lineaments of gratified desire what is it women do in men require the lineaments of gratified desire love ere he bleeds an eagle in high skies has earth beneath his wings from reddened eve he views the rosy dawn in vain they weave the fatal web below while far he flies but when the arrow strikes him theres a change he moves but in the track of his spent pain whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain binding him to the ground with narrow range a subtle serpent then has love become i had the eagle in my bosom erst henceforward with the serpent i am cursed i can interpret where the mouth is dumb speak and i see the side lie of a truth perchance my heart may pardon you this deed but be no coward you that made love bleed you must bear all the venom of his tooth not seeing me not even looking k on her silver cruiser charms her waythrough the last long moment of the changing light snow boots and a seychelles warblers old blue tights a rolled up yoga mat in her basketwobbling like a wild tiller as she pedals it feels illicit and somewhat right to stand across the intersection without shouting her name or even waving according to the internettutorial the fact that photons turn into tiny loyal billiard ballsas soon as we start watching suggestsno error of method or measurement but rather as far as anyone can tell an invisibly unstable world a shaking everywhere that seeing must pin down and fix so that morning i stumbled on youout alone bending throughthe traffic at orange and edwards streets a someone else then whom i alone can never otherwise see there has to be a kind of speechbeyond naming or even praise a discipline that locates light and lets it go i have been here before but when or how i cannot tell i know the grass beyond the door the sweet keen smell the sighing sound the lights around the shore you have been mine before how long ago i may not know but just when at that swallows soar your neck turnd so some veil did fall i knew it all of yore has this been thus before and shall not thus times eddying flight still with our lives our love restore in deaths despite and day and night yield one delight once more o tan faced prairie boy before you came to camp came many a welcome gift praises and presents came and nourishing food till at last among the recruits you came taciturn with nothing

many menrefuse or try to refusewhat needed to be done whether they could notfind it or were finding it disgusted theywithout it wandered like jamuqa when temujin entered the dark room the prisonerwas naked his genitals hung pendant bulbous as if swollenfrom rubbing he still is a creature that is beautiful but all dirty jamuqa said what you must do is kill me i will never accede to your power alive i will rally your enemies dead i will in their eyes just be one more fool temujin replied that hecould not they had been since boyhood anda without him would he have recoveredborte jamuqa replied that he did not want his skinbroken duringexecution he repeated twice i will never accede to your power temujin refused jamuqa wassick in the head healthy men dont want to die jamuqa escaped two men who temujin valueddied bringing him back then jamuqa escaped again when jamuqa wasreturned again temujinhesitated for months then he granted his wish he insisted the skin not be broken when he saw the body the head was severed as if someone for some reason had beenfurious temujin was furious with him for lettingpride somesickness of the mind poisonfeeling they had been since boyhood anda even the conqueror of the worldis powerless against the dead he saw smeltthe carcass ofjamuqa who had known that temujin was toosmart not to be by hisdeath forever tormented he watched you take from him what he thought washis the world of indolent chaosinhabited by the beautifuland lucky fuck anything that walks if that is whatever inside youdemands in the end the somethingthat was broken in him was mute he insisted that it did not exist viiithere was an immense silence between temujin and borte in the beginning sweetness because there had been no need to talk temujins father had taken him at nine on a journey to find temujin a bride she was ten and beautiful his father and her father were old allies and it was agreed on the way home the tat rs poisoned his father temujin was sixteen when they were at last married within days borte was abducted borte was abducted because when their camp was attacked there was only one free horse temujin thrust the horse at his mother not his wife this was as it should be borte knew this accepted this when she returned from those who had seized her she returned about to give birth temujin did not ask what humiliations she had endured whose child was it it could have been temujins or the creatures who took her temujin declared the child a son his he needed to be perceived among his own people as someone of impeccable justice someone whose rectitude is above vanity they had three more sons he needed legitimate sons borte raised as well orphans that temujins soldiers plucked from burning villages that they themselves had burned those thus saved proved to be among the fiercest the most loyal of his soldiers after borte returned the armies of temujin and jamuqa camped together for a year and a half borte and temujins mother found the closeness between the two men humiliating an insult an embarrassment borte and temujins mother told temujin that as long as he was tied to this debauched fickle friendship the other chiefs never would choose temujin as the great khan it was the first month of spring the two armies had to move off to fresh grazing temujin furious listened to the two women as if he were a statue he heard jamuqa say that camp pitched on the slopes of the mountain gave the herders of horses what they wanted but camp pitched on the banks of the river was better for the herders of sheep the women said that when night fell and jamuqas wagon stopped to pitch camp temujins wagon should continue temujins wagon as jamuqas wagon stopped to pitch camp on a mountainside continued as the night passed the clans realized what was happening and frightened debated to stop with jamuqa or stop with temujin schisms within a tribe even sometimes within a clan one shaman dreamt that a cow white as snow struck at jamuqas wagon until it broke one of its horns bellowing that jamuqa had to give back its lost horn striking the ground with its hoof the shaman dreamt that a white bull followed temujins wagon bellowing that heaven and earth have decided the empire should be temujins when temujin heard this he promised the shaman thirty concubines as day broke and temujin at last stopped count could be taken of which clans followed temujin and which stopped with jamuqa temujin camped near the sources of the onon the clans who had chosen temujin in the disorder and uncertainty of the night now were joined by others they had weighed the situation temujin was famous for the care and probity of his decisions the princes of the royal blood joined temujin many days passed before temujin looked directly at borte when they spoke she was the vehicle of necessity of what had to be he would not forgive her in time he lost interest in forgiving her when he returned from his last long campaign which lasted eight unbroken years he was grateful she did not ask about each nights new woman in time near the sources of the onon the princes of the royal blood elected temujin great khan fame clung to the story of how he saved the beautiful borte the irony was not lost on borte that as mother of orphans she was married to the force that made them orphans ixonly at the age of thirty nine temujinat last was master of

his tax collectorsin the future to tax this was a world everywhere on the edge of desert the mongols in fury dismantled the intricatenetworks that preserved and gathered and channeledwater without

his people curse except inimagination to everyone else the dream i dreamedwas not denied me it was not inthe mind denied me this is the end of the fourth hour of the night what lips my lips have kissed and where and why i have forgotten and what arms have lain under my head till morning but the rain is full of ghosts tonight that tap and sigh upon the glass and listen for reply and in my heart there stirs a quiet pain for unremembered lads that not again will turn to me at midnight with a cry thus in the winter stands the lonely tree nor knows what birds have vanished one by one yet knows its boughs more silent than before i cannot say what loves have come and gone i only know that summer sang in me a little while that in me sings no more like a lone arab old and blind some caravan had left behind who sits beside a ruind well where the shy sand asps bask and swell and now he hangs his ag e d head aslant and listens for a human sound in vain and now the aid which heaven alone can grant upturns his eyeless face from heaven to gain even thus in vacant mood one sultry hour resting my eye upon a drooping plant with brow low bent within my garden bower i sate upon the couch of camomile and whether twas a transient sleep perchance flitted across the idle brain the whilei watchd the sickly calm with aimless scope in my own heart or that indeed a trance turnd my eye inward thee o genial hope loves elder sister thee did i beholddrest as a bridesmaid but all pale and cold with roseless cheek all pale and cold and dim lie lifeless at my feet and then came love a sylph in bridal trim and stood beside my seat she bent and kissd her sisters lips as she was wont to do alas twas but a chilling breathwoke just enough of life in death to make hope die anew now that the winters gone the earth hath lost her snow white robes and now no more the frost candies the grass or casts an icy cream upon the silver lake or crystal stream but the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth and makes it tender gives a sacred birth to the dead swallow wakes in hollow tree the drowsy cuckoo and the humble bee now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring in triumph to the world the youthful spring the valleys hills and woods in rich array welcome the coming of the longd for may now all things smile only my love doth lour nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power to melt that marble ice which still doth hold her heart congeald and makes her pity cold the ox which lately did for shelter fly into the stall doth now securely lie in open fields and love no more is made by the fireside but in the cooler shade amyntas now doth with his chloris sleep under a sycamore and all things keep time with the season only she doth carry june in her eyes in her heart january i gave you a tiny box you lifted the lid praised the usefulness of my gift a silver pin shaped like an amper sand as you fastened it to your lapel i thought again of that motel outside of chicago te acuerdas i sat on the edge of a bench untied my shoes face down eyes shut you breathed inthe aroma of sweat allspice coming off the sheets i tossed my ring gold inscribed toward a pile of clothes but the ring dropped in the small of your back where it rattled rattled like a coin in a beggars cup then there was the time i looked directly into the face of the life i thought i was missing of love i used to think to be not alone meant never having to walk through the high wheat or struggle in the water not having to decide notto fling from some height once the two of us rode one bicycle i wore a straw hat and perched on the handlebars and beside us the sea oats swayed like skirts and i heard a trilling in the crabgrass the sidewalks were bleached as grecian stoneas we rode past the fish shop smelling of morning salt bread limes men riding in front it was such that i could not be heard always at least not the first timefor you pedaled into the wind and my hair was a ribbon in your eyes i said i thought bougainvillea was a stoic plant and then had to say twice no stoic and then no the bougainvillea and then you said easily it was nothing like that at all but our future was clear enough when i asked if you saw the clean aprons of those men how much longer you think until they clean the fish did you see how white those aprons were did you see to which you said how much is it then you think you need oh how the hand the lover ought to prize bove any one peculiar grace while he is dying for the eyes and doting on the lovely face the unconsidring little knows how much he to this beauty owes that when the lover absent is informs him of his mistress heart tis that which gives him all his bliss when dear love secrets twill impart that plights the faith the maid bestows and that

the liner noteson a life you measure song by song now everywhere the pageantry of youth is on display the squeal of bike chains spinning through the gray plays fugue to puddle froth the punctual blitz of hyacinths in april ushers springwith lavender dripped from the upturned wing of wind swept gabriel a youngish pair walks wired at the arms she casually ribbinghim he lightly brushing her breast jibbing their step to spare the wormsstranded along the road too soon their laughter rises and goesdrifting toward silence and now the young man knows loves not the song but after like the mute remembered chorus of the rain that stains the walklong after falling or the lifeless stalk still hoisting its head of grain uneasy now she loosens from his hand their dark familiarsstare back reflected by the passing cars with speechless reprimand before the chill each chartered hell grows hotter yet every burnwill teach him how to run and how to turn her wine back into water unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty runs this poor river charged with streams of zeal returning thee the tribute of my duty which here my love my youth my plaints reveal here i unclasp the book of my charged soul where i have cast thaccounts of all my care here have i summed my sighs here i enroll how they were spent for thee look what they are look on the dear expenses of my youth and see how just i reckon with thine eyes examine well thy beauty with my truth and cross my cares ere greater sum arise read it sweet maid though it be done but slightly who can show all his love doth love but lightly as she grows to twelve her body begins its spring its hike along the trail in the mountains that open suddenly to show a whole valley so surprising one forgets for the moment to breathe her hips and so her walk her breasts and so the way she begins to see how other people look at her how they are caught mid breath and shy but the day a train first came here they look at her like that no one staring at her face no one noting a moustache curling up like the arms of the bald he man posing in the traveling circus there on the face of the engineer she gets angry steam in her head the way the engine had barely held in almost bursting angry in the manner that a person might take an egg and hold it too hard her breasts begin to grow and she gets angry or she gets angry so her breasts begin to grow she cannot remember exactly which her mother had told her this would come but told her so quickly so much in a hurry and in a small room and with the other things she neglected to say that also they would stop growing so they might not she would have to wear she learns this in a dream high heels backward on her feet to keep a symmetry of balance the angrier she gets through the months the more worried she feels at the silliness of how she has begun to grow two new shoulders of how she will have to wear her shoes as bigger one centimeter at a time she sprouts out like buds at first like fast plants then like the trees and finally unstoppable in their season fruit the future she reasons cannot be good at she has forgotten what is past she sits and watches now her thighs flowing out like the broad varicosed backs of alligators she has seen in moving pictures pushed out around the metal edges of the lawn chair long and flat animals sated and full of wrinkling ridges held as if by small bones the way camping tents are suspended all from having eaten too many pigs too many birds and cows in the summers of her middle years of crying when she was all mouth and chewing to feel better all without boys no pedro of her own and now the boys cannot come close dare not dare the alligators which might come after them but no this is an exaggeration this sadness at het self sadness is like that adding weight to a thing to legs the way legs look as one sits in a chair relaxed or on the edge of a wall as if one were a circus performer with a partner ram n ram n standing feet planted this moment precisely on the thighs but no this is a further exaggeration sadness again is like that it learns you she thinks makes you heavy in those places exactly you have dared think to be strong on thursday the th of this month miguel her husband left her but in that odd physics of how distance increased every step she took away from him as she left the house he got farther as she his mar a walked out the door he left her and the more she walked the farther he got and smaller she had learned him as one learns a pair of good leather shoes she loved him so much she stopped thinking about him he was like breathing so that when sadness called she went to see what it wanted and did not worry sadness again is like that not telling a person the whole story the orchard was his passion now more than women more than hard words and fast guns in the hands of other men and he tended his trees with fingers he might have used touching the hair of his young cousin lovely marta his wife light skinned eyes the color in the moss and barks of his trees who walked to the river and stayed fingers that might have pointed out to her with care the beaten line a trail made leading to his house their house but he was busy growing the limes so that her hair was like a bramble having to be torn away hard from her leaving the blood all of this she said to him and it was true or not true in a day or a week she would know sadness was in her growing like the unstoppable breasts again but it would stop as it had learned her she had learned it she knew only that next she would have to get the high heels the dream had come again put them on backward to keep a symmetry of balance for what she wanted to do walk backward to the moment her breasts were those small animals just big enough to touch him with their mouths not angry a great light is the man who knows the woman he loves a great light is the woman who knows the man she loves and carries the light into room after room arousing the sleepers and looking hard into the face of each and then sends them asleep again with a kiss or a whole night of love and goes on and on until the man and woman who carry the great lights of the knowledge of the one lover enter the room toward which their light is sent and fit the one and the other torch in a high candelabrum and there is such light that children leap up unless the sea swallow them in the crossing or hatred or war against which do not pray only but be vigilant and set your hand to the work both lying on our sides making love in spoon position when shes startled whats that she means the enormous ship passing before you maybe not that large is it a freighter or a passenger ship but it seems huge in the dark and its so close thats a poem you say d h lawrence have you built your ship of death have you o build your ship of death for you will need it right here it would be good if there were a small orchestra on board youd hear them and say to her that piece is called autumn thats what the brave musicians played as the titanic went under and then you could name this poem autumn but no the ship is silent its white lights glow in the darkness agathas four and forty lovers had agathas in the old days all of whom she refused and now she turns to me seeking love and her hair also is turning young lady i have fed your lar with poppies i have adored you for three full years and now you grumble because your dress does not fit and because i happen to say so lesbia illa memnon memnon that lady who used to walk about amongst us with such gracious uncertainty is now wedded to a british householder lugete veneres lugete cupidinesque passing flawless as aphrodite thoroughly beautiful brainless the faint odor of your patchouli faint almost as the lines of cruelty about your chin assails me and concerns me almost as little think not this paper comes with vain pretense to move your pity or to mourn th offense too well i know that hard obdurate heart no softening mercy there will take my part nor can a womans arguments prevail when even your patrons wise example fails but this last privilege i still retain th oppressed and injured always may complain too too severely laws of honor bind the weak submissive sex of womankind if sighs have gained or force compelled our hand deceived by art or urged by stern command whatever motive binds the fatal tie the judging world expects our constancy just heaven for sure in heaven does justice reign though tricks below that sacred name profane to you appealing i submit my cause nor fear a judgment from impartial laws all bargains but conditional are made the purchase void the creditor unpaid defrauded servants are from service free a wounded slave regains his liberty for wives ill used no remedy remains to daily racks condemned and to eternal chains from whence is this unjust distinction grown are we not formed with passions like your own nature with equal fire our souls endued our minds as haughty and as warm our blood oer the wide world your pleasures you pursue the change is justified by something new but we must sigh in silence and be true our sexs weakness you expose and blame of every prattling fop the common theme yet from this weakness you suppose is due sublimer virtue than your cato knew had heaven designed us trials so severe it would have formed our tempers then to bear and i have borne oh what have i not borne the pang of jealousy the insults of scorn wearied at length i from your sight remove and place my future hopes in secret love in the gay bloom of glowing youth retired i quit the womans joy to be admired with that small pension your hard heart allows renounce your fortune and release your vows to custom though unjust so much is due i hide my frailty from the public view my conscience clear yet sensible of shame my life i hazard to preserve my fame and i prefer this low inglorious state to vile dependence on the thing i hate but you pursue me to this last retreat dragged into light my tender crime is shown and every circumstance of fondness known beneath the shelter of the law you stand and urge my ruin with a cruel hand while to my fault thus rigidly severe tamely submissive to the man you fear this wretched outcast this abandoned wife has yet this joy to sweeten shameful life by your mean conduct infamously loose you are at once my accuser and excuse let me be damned by the censorious prude stupidly dull or spiritually lewd my hapless case will surely pity find from every just and reasonable mind when to the final sentence i submit the lips condemn me but their souls aquit no more my husband to your pleasures go the sweets of your recovered freedom know go court the brittle friendship of the great smile at his board or at his levee wait and when dismissed to madams toilet fly more than her chambermaids or glasses lie tell her how young she looks how heavenly fair admire the lilies and the roses there your high ambition may be gratified some cousin of her own be made your bride and you the father of a glorious race endowed with ch ls strength and low rs face since so ye please to hear me plain and that ye do rejoice my smart me list no lenger to remain to such as be so overthwart but cursed be that cruel heart which hath procurd a careless mind for me and mine unfeigned smart and forceth me such faults to find more than too much i am assured of thine intent whereto to trust a speedless proof i have endured and now i leave it to them that lust i was ill lying on my bed of old papers when you came with white rabbits in your arms and the doves scattered upwards flying to mothers and the snails sighed under their baggage of stone now your tongue grows like celery between us because of our love cries cabbage darkens in its nest the cauliflower thinks of her pale plump children and turns greenish white in a light like the oceans i was sick fainting in the smell of teabags when you came with tomatoes a good poetry i am being wooed i am being conquered by a cliff of limestone that leaves chalk on my breasts these guys try to make usmatch moods to productsthe way once under loves

am i but an hors and horses lawe i moot endure and with my feres drawe i forgot to tell you its almost time to go the sun has distilled its particular worn essence and the glittering trout is flipped on the bow a man asks me what time it is i dont know i have emptied my purse and wept in the presence of onlookers i forgot to remember to go before eleven when the steely arrow shot swimming to its underneath tense as a stream of salmon in reverse below the laureled relentless clocks the sceptered row of columns dreams one oclock immense inviolate what time is it i dont know this story concerns the night i tried to go though many times i flopped into the silence of orange plastic seating like onto the bow of a lonely ship and felt my breathing slow the frail retreating stand of columns prevents the clocks from telling me time and time again to go at my feet a glittering trout swims past the bow this is not a book otherwise by now we would love each other you would not put me first out of a kind habit under your coat and clutch as a sudden rain spate down for ive seen it done for the hardly known no you would know with a book you love how nothing held your eyes the way the words did with archer focus how each arrow heading toward you was slowed by the dripping beehive on its spike nothing else could hold what you are still i pressed your heart in speech and saw what a musical you let rush nothing else in the eyes this is not a book but a streak words cross reins the brow splits veins careen she walks in beauty like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies and all thats best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes thus mellowed to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies one shade the more one ray the less had half impaired the nameless grace which waves in every raven tress or softly lightens oer her face where thoughts serenely sweet express how pure how dear their dwelling place and on that cheek and oer that brow so soft so calm yet eloquent the smiles that win the tints that glow but tell of days in goodness spent a mind at peace with all below a heart whose love is innocent they were sitting on the thin mattress hed once rolled carried up the four floors to his room only to find it covered nearly all of the bare wood leaving just a small path alongside the wall between them was the sack of oranges pears shed brought its neck turned back to expose the colors of the fruit as she opened a bottle of wine he reached over to a tall stack of books pulled out the tao with a silly flourish handed it across the bed to her she looked up simply poured the two squat water glasses half full with wine then she took the book reading silently not aloud as hed assumed suddenly he felt clearly she knew the way two people must come upon such an understanding together of course but separately as the moon the wave remain individually one what i would like to give them for a change is not the usual prescription with its hubris of the power to restore to cure what i would like to give them ill from not enough of laying in the sun not caring what the onlookers might think while feeding some banana to their dogs what i would like to offer them is this not reassurance that their lungs sound fine or that the mole theyve noticed change is not a melanoma but instead of fear transfigured by some doctorly advice id like to give them my astonishment at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping and how ridiculously gently it slicked down my hair id like to give them that the joy i felt while staring in your eyes as you learned epidemiology the science of disease in populations the night around our bed like timelessness like comfort like what i would give to them o call not me to justify the wrongthat thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue use power with power and slay me not by art tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside what needst thou wound with cunning when thy mightis more than my oerpressed defense can bide let me excuse thee ah my love well knowsher pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries yet do not so but since i am near slain kill me outright with looks and rid my pain oh fairest of the rural maids thy birth was in the forest shades green boughs and glimpses of the sky were all that met thine infant eye thy sports thy wanderings when a child were even in the sylvan wild and all the beauty of the place is in thy heart and on thy face the twilight of the trees and rocks is in the light shade of thy locks thy step is as the wind that weaves its playful way among the leaves thine eyes are springs in whose serene and silent waters heaven is seen their lashes are the herbs that look on their young figures in the brook the forest depths by foot unpressed are not more sinless than thy breast the holy peace that fills the air of those calm solitudes is there yesterday everything was possible today were good as married you dont want to hear that do you thinking im going to call you back in from the rain to fight over the morning paper limning my deft and emotional promiscuities that well sit in our sitting room watching the shaggy junipers twirl in winter wind as a storm closes its throat around the city im thinking about how to ask god to be nicer im thinking about that fabled leper colony where the last solitary patient waited inside its unlocked tower three years in the belief she could not step outside and how the local doctors visited only to re wrap her face to brush out her last gold strands of hair wondering how to save anybody so willing to kill herself with denial they wanted to talk about pain the doctors to say one day youll be half asleep in the dark listening to a radio play in another room and feel yourself suddenly filling like a jug with the cold awareness nothing more will ever happen the disaster of your old ambivalence the familiarity of desires wolfish teeth sinking into the body the body as if it didnt belong to you anymore the doctors said fear should never be elevated to ritual they told the woman you must change your life one day im on the steps of an office tower losing a shoe the next im screaming on a gurney im stuffing a baby into a diaper im wondering the woods in my scar dark cape every story has an archetype doesnt it and if so why arent we married why cant we be just like everyone else this fucking fucking once god i hate the way this tale is turning out two aged strangers learning to tuck in their blood hiding the knives and bread crumbs deep inside their pockets look this time i swear i wont run really ill come and go from my stone room without a mirror all my extremities taped in white ill learn to knit with three fingers ill learn to read into the deepening silences to be nice to your step sisters singing to drown out the tears of their ugliness i love you can i even say that in this story i want to spend the rest of my life growing quietly bored with you locking away loom and spindle sweeping out the piles of rose petals and ash for once i plan to triumph over smug experience i marry you dont hit me please just come in from the stars awhile sit here in this sitting room let me find you another section of the paper to argue over the doctors said i get to wear a suit they said ill be released next thursday listen even now the junipers are whispering their dark good byes thin limbs smocked in white a riderless horse has appeared on the horizon and somewhere out in the meretricious night somebodys life is quietly changing there is a garden in her face where roses and white lilies blow a heavenly paradise is that place wherein all pleasant fruits do flow there cherries grow which none may buy till cherry ripe themselves do cry those cherries fairly do enclose of orient pearl a double row which when her lovely laughter shows they look like rose buds filled with snow yet them no peer nor prince can buy till cherry ripe themselves do cry her eyes like angels watch them still her brows like bended bows do stand threatning with piercing frowns to kill all that attempt with eye or hand those sacred cherries to come nigh till cherry ripe themselves do cry re reading him in bouchon past noon it is mobbed midtown like an ant farm seen through painkillers god what a bust its all been capitalism communism feminism this lust to liberate che should have stayed in medicine the girls here admit they cant wait to marry and get to the alimony before they hit thirty the men heads skinned like lager inmates know only the revolutions in diets and spinning classes still one table away these two with gnarled empretzled hands seem unhappy in the old way it has been so wet stones glaze in moss everything blooms coldly i expect you i thought one night it was you at the base of the drive you at the foot of the stairs you in a shiver of light but each time leaves in wind revealed themselves the retreating shadow of a fox daybreak we expect you cat and i bluebirds and i the stove in may we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires over which young men and women leapt june efforts quietly ive planted vegetables along each garden wall so even if spring continues to disappoint we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain i have new gloves and a new hoe i practice eulogies he was a hawk with white feathered legs she had the quiet ribs of a salamander crossing the old pony post road yours is the name the leaves chatter at the edge of the unrabbited woods the shadows of birds fading on a fighters back the undressing of words on an unstamped postcard the wet swings in the distant park the jealousy of raindrops on the umbrella of lovers the laughter of a boy before a bird the song of two flutes two swords two bracelets two fingers the stare of a wave before a pearl the yearning between the legs of a farmers wife the opening of doors closing midday the sudden howling of our muse and les ventails disturbing the guest inside of us when thou must home to shades of underground and there arrived a new admir d guest the beauteous spirits do engirt thee round white iope blithe helen and the rest to hear the stories of thy finished love from that smooth tongue whose music hell can move then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights of masques and revels which sweet youth did make of tourneys and great challenges of knights and all these triumphs for thy beautys sake when thou hast told these honours done to thee then tell o tell how thou didst murder me i had not thought of violets late the wild shy kind that spring beneath your feetin wistful april days when lovers mateand wander through the fields in raptures sweet the thought of violets meant florists shops and bows and pins and perfumed papers fine and garish lights and mincing little fopsand cabarets and soaps and deadening wines so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed i had forgot wide fields and clear brown streams the perfect loveliness that god has made wild violets shy and heaven mounting dreams and now unwittingly youve made me dreamof violets and my souls forgotten gleam tonight my sparrows let go the snow into fields of carnations swollen with anger tonight the three popes proclaim the revolution against teenage television seals smash their heads bloody their heads on the elevators the paternoster elevators which delays the holding of their conference tonight my sister the winds bride gives blood for the cello of the jericho desert which prompts the trombones to hold a protest meeting tonight i hang your lips like birdseed outside my door and observe through the window their death struggle with the she vulture tonight let go the snow the message i found on the post it note went thus love truth expect to be found out kid style capitals proved i wrote it but

hes not the like of you he treads his path of reckoned days a sober man and true theyll never see him in the town another on his knee hed cut his laden orchards down if that would pleasure me hed give his blood to paint my lips if i should wish them red he prays to touch my finger tips or stroke my prideful head he never weaves a glinting lie or brags the hearts hell keep i have forgotten how to

nigh on certain shell have to take a bulletor well see her in prison blue as they lead her to the drop the fragments of glass were part of it too thats plain though no one noticed just as they failed

with the rub of the greenon her back for all to see and devil may care his smell still on her reek of the barley mow and hers on him which could have been sloeor sweat and sandalwood but youd be the one to know since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality oer sways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower o how shall summers honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of battring days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays o fearful meditation where alack shall

long hence or quite soon quite soon and which will my bride be the right or the wrong the wrong and my remedy what kind wealth wove or earth hewn earth hewn the heart dies without space for love without a moral horizon think of it then as a bird trapped in a box my heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence only toward them can one really advance that is make progress without them i feel im half a person romeo was born a montague and juliet came from the capulet line and im a disciple of shakespeare not ben gurion therefore ill be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of haidar abdel shafi i mean this of course as a parable only but the parable is my measure and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair this isnt just some idle fancy that out of poetic license i place our fate in my daughters sex that i grant myself this imaginary gift testifies to the extent to which were living still in the underworld where were granted the hope and potential of an amoeba but all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl spring out of the ground and devour each other until a sacred union occurs healing the breach in the world the arab groom from gaza too will extend to my daughter a dress on which is embroidered the land redeemed from apartheids curse our land as a whole belonging equally to all of its offspring and then hell lift the veil from her face and say to her and now i take you to be my wife lotem abdel shafi the chain uncouples and his jacket hangs on the peg over hers and hes inside she stalls in the kitchen putting the kettle on buys herself a minute looking for two matching cups for the lime flower tea not really lime but linden heart shaped leaves and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze she talks a wall around her twists the string tighter around the tea bag in her spoon but every conversation has to break somewhere and at the far end of the sofa he sits warming his hands around the cup he hasnt tasted yet and listens on with such an exasperating show of patience its almost a relief to hear him ask it if youre not using your body right now maybe youd let me borrow it for a while it isnt what youre thinking no its worse why on earth did she find him so attractive the first time she met him propping the wall at an awkward party clearly trying to drink himself into some sort of conversation was it the dark uncomfortable reserve she took upon herself to tease him out of asking are you a vampire that depends he stammered are you a virgin no not funny but why did she laugh at him what made her think that he needed her that she could teach him something why did she let him believe she was drunk and needed a ride home why did she let him take her shirt off fumble around a bit on the spare futon passing back and forth the warm breath of a half hearted kiss they kept falling asleep in the middle of and when he asked her why did she not object id like to try something i need you to trust me younger and given to daydreams she imagined trading bodies with someone a best friend the boy she had a crush on but the fact was more fantastic a fairy tale adventure where the wolf wins and hides in the girls red hood how it happens she doesnt really remember drifting off with a vague sense of being drawn out through a single point of her skin like a bedsheet threaded through a needles eye and bundled into a body that must be his sometimes she startles as on the verge of sleep you can feel yourself fall backward over a brink and snaps her eyelids open to catch herself slipping out of the bed her legs swinging over the edge and feels the sudden sick split screen impression of being for a second both she and her what he does with her while shes asleep she never really knows flickers only conducted back in dreams walking in neighborhoods she doesnt know and wouldnt go to overpasses ragweed cars dry docked on cinderblocks wolf whistles wanting to run away and yet her steps planted sure and defiant performing tasks too odd to recognize and too mundane to have made up like fixing a green salad with the sunflower seeds and peppers that she hates pouring on twice the oil and vinegar that she would like and being unable to stop her hands feel but are somehow not her own running over the racks of stacked fabric in a clothing store stroking the slick silk teased cotton and polar fleece as if her fingers each were a tongue tasting the knits and weaves harmless enough its what she doesnt dream that scares her panic she cant account for faces familiar but not known d j vu making a mess of memory coming to with a fresh love bite on her left breast and the aftershock of granting anothers flesh of having gripped slipped in and fluttered tender mmm unbraided and spent the whole slow day clutching her thighs to keep the chafe from fading and furious at being joyful less at the violation less the danger than the sense hed taken her enjoyment for his own that was the time before the time she swore would be the last returning to her senses shed grabbed his throat and hit him around the face and threw him out and sat there on the floor shaking she hadnt known how hard it was to throw a punch without pulling it back now as they sit together on her couch with the liquid cooling in the stained chipped cups that would never match no matter how hard she stared at them he seems the same as ever a quiet clumsy self effacing ghost with the gray circled eyes that she once wanted so badly to defy that seemed to see her seeing him and she has to admit shes missed him why she scrolls back through their conversations searching for any reason not to hate him shed ask him whats it like being a girl when youre not a girl his answers when he gave them werent helpful so evasively poetic its like a sponge somebody else is squeezing a radio tuned to all stations at once like having skin thats softer but more thick then she remembers the morning she awoke with the smear of tears still raw across her cheeks and the spent feeling of having cried herself down to the bottom of something why was i crying she asked and he looked back blankly with that little curve of a lip that served him for a smile because i cant and that would be their secret the power to feel another appetite pass through her like a shudder like a cold lungful of oxygen or hot sweet smoke fill her and then be stilled the freedom to fall asleep behind the blinds of his dark body and wake cleanly and when she swings her legs over the edge of the bed to trust her feet to hit the carpet and know as not before how she never quite trusted the floor to be there no not since she was a girl first learning to swim hugging her skinny breastless body close to the pool gutter skirting along the dark and darker blue of the bottom dropping out now she can stand and take the cup out of his giving hand and feel what they have learned inside each other fair and enough and not without a kind of satisfaction that she can put her foot down clear to the bottom of desire and find that it can stop and go no deeper the lowest trees have tops the ant her gall the fly her spleen the little sparks their heat the slender hairs cast shadows though but small and bees have stings although they be not great seas have their source and so have shallow springs and love is love in beggars as in kings where rivers smoothest run deep are the fords the dial stirs yet none perceives it move the firmest faith is in the fewest words the turtles cannot sing and yet they love true hearts have eyes and ears no tongues to speak they hear and see and sigh and then they break bilbea i was in babylon on saturday night i saw nothing of you anywhere i was at the old place and the other girls were there but no bilbea have you gone to another house or city why dont you write i was sorry i walked home half sick tell me how it goes send me some kind of a letter and take care of yourself of many reasons i love you here is one the way you write me from the gate at the airport so i can tell you everything will be alright so you can tell me there is a bird trapped in the terminal all the people ignoring it because they do not know what to do with it except to leave it alone until it scares itself to death it makes you terribly terribly sad you wish you could take the bird outside and set it free or failing that call a bird understander to come help the bird all you can do is notice the bird and feel for the bird and write to tell me how language feels impossibly useless but you are wrong you are a bird understander better than i could ever be who make so many noises and call them song these are your own words your way of noticing and saying plainly of not turning away from hurt you have offered them to me i am only giving them back if only i could show you how very useless they are not the dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows pasted with colored squares past the man who leans into the phone booths red pagoda past crates of doves and roosters veiled until dawn fireworks complicate the streets with sulphur as people exchange gold and silver foil money to appease ghosts who linger needy even in death i am almost invisible hands could pass through me effortlessly this is how it is to be so alien that my name falls from me grows untranslatable as the shop signs the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle in the stairwell the corridor where the doors are blue months ajar hands gesture in the smoke the partial moon of a face for hours the soft numeric click of mah jongg tiles drifts down the hallway where languid mai trails her musk of sex and narcotics there is no grief in this only the old year consuming itself the door knob blazing in my hand beneath the lightbulbs electric jewel between voices and fireworks wind works bricks to dust hush hush no language i want to learn i can touch the sill worn by hands ill never know in this room with its low table where i brew chrysanthemum tea the sign for jade palace sheds green corollas on the floor its dangerous to stand here in the chastening glow darkening my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest of my life widening away from me waiting for the man i married to pass beneath the sign of the building to climb the five flights and say his chinese name for me hell rise up out of the puzzling streets where men pass bottles of rice liquor where the new year is liquor the black bottle the whole district is waiting for like some benevolent arrest the moment when men and women turn to each other and dissolve each bad bet every sly mischance the dalliance of hands they turn in lamplight the way i turn now wai min is in the doorway he brings fish he brings lotus root he brings me ghost money why are you bugging me you stank minuscule husk of musk muster deliberation crawling over reasons and possessions i have have not touched should i fail in my insecticide i pray for a black boy who lifts you to a flame with bedeviled tweezers until mercy rises disappears you are the size of a stuttering drop of liquid milk machine oil semen blood yes you funky stud you are the jewel in the knob of an elegant butt plug snug between pleasure disgust you are the scent of rot at the heart of lovemaking the meat inside your exoskeleton is as tender as jesus neruda wrote of a nipple perfuming the earth yes you are an odor an almost imperceptible ode to death a lousy stinking stinkbug once iwas seven spanish bullocks in a high meadow sleepy and nameless as ifness strange to myself but complete light on the neck napeof timeas two wings of one starling or lovers so happy neither needs think of the other incautious youth why dost thou so mis place thy fine encomiums on an oer blown face which after all the varnish of thy quill its pristine wrinkles shew apparent still nor is it in the power of youth to move an age chilld heart to any strokes of love then chuse some budding beauty which in time may crown thy wishes in thy blooming prime for nought can make a more preposterous show than aprils flowers stuck on st michaels bow to consecrate thy first born sighs to me a superannuated deity makes that idolatry and deadly sin which otherwise had only venial been i am doing laps at night alone in the indoor pool outside it is snowing but i am warm and weightless suspended and out of time like a fly in amber she is thousands of miles from here and miles above me ghosting the stratosphere heading from new york to london though it is late even at that height i know her light is on her window a square of gold as she reads mysteries above the atlantic i watch the line of black tile on the pools floor leading me down the lane if she looks down by moonlight under a clear sky she will see black water she will see me swimming distantly moving far from shore suspended with her in flight through the wide gulf as we swim toward land together when my grave is broke up again some second guest to entertain for graves have learnd that woman head to be to more than one a bed and he that digs it spies a bracelet of bright hair about the bone will he not letus alone and think that there a loving couple lies who thought that this device might be some way to make their souls at the last busy day meet at this grave and make a little stay if this fall in a time or land where mis devotion doth command then he that digs us up will bring us to the bishop and the king to make us relics then thou shalt be a mary magdalen and i a something else thereby all women shall adore us and some men and since at such time miracles are sought i would have that age by this paper taught what miracles we harmless lovers wrought first we lovd well and faithfully yet knew not what we lovd nor why difference of sex no more we knew than our guardian angels do coming and going we perchance might kiss but not between those meals our hands neer touchd the seals which nature injurd by late law sets free these miracles we did but now alas all measure and all language i should pass should i tell what a miracle she was yes i was jealous when you threw the glass i wanted the shattering against the wood paneled floor for myself to be the sudden diaspora of its pieces across the apartment and last nightwhen we fought i wanted you to hit me so badly i begged and the other day walking past renewal on the bowery when one of the men smoking unsteadily outsidecalled me a faggot i thought good people get what they deserve then i wished i were more like jesus capable of lovingall people and all things always capable of nothingbut love i waste half my wishes this way wishing to be virtuous the rest well i dont have to tell you do i its you id like to see greece again withyou id like to take to bed of cyclamenyou know i nurse a certain mythabout myself that i descendde tribus dorigine asiatiqueand am part thracian or macedoniancleaving to a hellenic mystiqueafter

wire and roses burning briars like flames devour their too innocent attire dare they meet the blackened wire tears the intervening air trespassers have wandered through texture of flesh and petals dogs like arrows moved along pathways that their noses knew while the two who laid it out find the metal and the flower fatal underfoot black and white at midnight glows this garden of barbed wire and roses doused with darkness roses burn coolly as a rainy moon beneath a rainy moon or none silver the sheath on barb and thorn change the garden scale and plan wall it make it annual there the briary flower grew there the brambled wire ran while they sleep the garden grows deepest wish annuls the will perfect still the wire and rose because i must walk through the eye shaped shadows cast by these curved gold leaves thick atop each constructed palm tree past displays of silk scarves lit silhouettes of blue bottled perfume because i grip as though for the first time a paper bag of french fries from mcdonalds and lick from each fingertip the fat and salt as i stand alone to the side of this moving walkway gliding me past dark eyed men who do not look away when i stare squarely back because standing in line to the restroom i want only to pluck from her black sweater this one shimmering blond hair clinging fast because i must rest the coke cold in my hand beside this toilet seat warmed by her thighs her thighs and hers here at the narrow mouth of this long humid corridor leading to the plane i take my place among this damp dark horde of men and women who look like me because i look

ripe with darknessand bones white luster in the moonlit blue house where snow wont fallunless called upon grace enters as requested lands next to you grasped as if love were a reflexsimple as weather a peacock on an olive branch looks beyond the grove to the road beyond the road to the sea blank lit where a sailboat anchors to a cove as it is morning below deck a man is pouring water into a cup listening to the radio talk of the ships barges dead in the calms awaiting port call pleasure boats whose lights hours ago went out fishermen setting their nets for mullet as summer tavernas hang octopus to dry on their lines whisper smoke into wood ovens sweep the terraces clear of night putting the music out with morning light and for the breath of an hour it is possible to consider the waters of this sea wine dark to remember that there was no word for blue among the ancients but there was the whirring sound before the oars of the great triremes sang out of the seam of world through pine sieved winds silvered by salt flats until they were light enough to pass for breath from the heavens troubled enough to fell ships and darken thought then as now the clouds pass roosters sleep in their huts the sea flattens under glass air but there is nothing to hold us there not the quiet of marble nor the luff of sail fields of thyme a vineyard at harvest and the sea filled with the bones of those in flight from wars east and south our wars their remains scavenged on the seafloor and in its caves belongings now a flotsam washed to the rocks stand here and look into the distant haze there where the holy mountain with its thousand monks wraps itself in shawls of rain then look to the west where the rubber boats tipped into the tough waves rest your eyes there remembering the words of anacreon himself a refugee of war who appears in the writings of herodotus i love and do not love i am mad and i am not mad like you he thought himself not better nor worse than anyone else i wont let anybody take a drink out of this barrel of tears ive collected from you least of all another woman i see her coming along i know the type i can tell you what shell be wearing i know the type i wont like it shell look at that barrel shes had a few in her day not that shes ever filled one shell remark casually sweet water good to wash my hair and who doesnt know tears are purer than rain water and softer on the hair just as she steps toward it and makes for the cup ill see phantom you and what you were brought up by the sea and scraps of paper from this ditch of my brain will float on the water and choke her its not about the sex really its not the ache of the bruised nipple or the burn left by his two day old beard in the crook of my neck where the pulse is taken its his breathing when asleep that draws me near when i was seventeen id check beside me hope i hadnt rolled and squashed flat my one year old brother his sigh on my ear the rise and fall of air beneath his ribs was a miracle to me the nightly surprise of what i saw under the bulbs dim glow i saw the small heart beating like wings unfolding in the body here with this man ideas of flight return all my stories are about being left all yours about leaving so we should have known should have known to leave well enough alone we knew and we didnt you said lets put our cards on the table your card was your body the table my bed where we didnt get till am so tired from wanting what we shouldnt that when we finally found our heads wed lost our minds love i wanted to call you so fast but so slow you could taste each letter licked into your particular and rose like ear l love for lets wait o for oh no lets not v for the precious v between your deep breasts and the virtue of your fingers in the voluptuous center of me okay e for enough dawn broke or shattered once weve made the promises its hard to add the prefix if but not so wrong to try that means taking a lot of walks which neither of us is good at for different reasons and nights up till arguing whose reasons are better time and numbers count a lot in this years my marriage years you my friend th of july weekend when something that begins in mist by mistake whose means too much has to end i think we need an abacus to get our love on course and one of us to oil the shining rods so we can keep the crazy beads clicking clicking it wasnt a question of a perfect fit theoretically it should be enough to say i left a man for a woman of the world is content to leave it at that oh lazy world and when the woman lost her nerve i left for greater concerns when words like autonomy were useful i used them i confess so i get what i deserve a studio apartment he paid the rent on bookshelves up to the ceiling she drove the screws for and a skylight i sleep alone beneath and two shiny quarters in my pocket to call one then the other or to call one twice once twice i threatened to leave him remember now that ive done it he says he doesnt im in a phonebooth at the corner of bank and greenwich not a booth exactly but two sheets of glass to shiver between this is called being street smart dialing a number that you know wont be answered but the message you leave leaves proof that you tried and this my two dearly beloveds is this called hedging your bets i fish out my other coin turn it over in my fingers press it into the slot hold it there let it drop i only have a moment so let me tell you the shortest story about arriving at a long loved place the house of friends in maine their lawn of wildflowers their grandfather clock and candidportraits their gabled attic rooms and woodstove in the kitchen all accessories of the genuine summer years before when i wastheir sons girlfriend and tied an apron behind my neck beneathmy braids and took from their garden the harvest for a dinneri would make alone and serve at their big table with the gladnessof the found and loved the eggplant shone like polished wood the tomatoes smelled like their furred collars the dozen zucchinilined up on the counter like placid troops with the onions theirminions and i even remember the garlic each clove from its airmail envelope brought to the cutting board ready for my instruction and in this very slight story a decade later i came by myself having been dropped by the airport cab and waited for the familyto arrive home from work i walked into the lawn waist highin the swaying purple lupines the subject of junes afternoon lightas i had never been addressed a displaced young woman withcropped hair no place to which i wished to return and no oneto gather me in his arms that day the lupines received me and i was in love with them because they were all i had left and in that same manner i have loved much of the world since then and who is to say there is more of a reason or more to love im a rattling boy from dublin town i courted a girl called biddy brown her eyes they were as black as sloes she had black hair and an aquiline nose chorus whack fal de da fal de darelido whack fal de da fal de darelay whack fal de da fal de darelido whack fal de da fal de darelay one night i met her with another lad says i biddy ive caught you by dad i never thought you were half so bad as to be going about with another lad chorus says i biddy this will never do for to night youve provd to me untrue so do not make a hullaballoo for i will bid farewell to you chorus says barney magee she is my lass and the man that says no he is an ass so come away and ill give you a glass och sure you can get another lass chorus says i to the devil with your glass you have taken from me my darling lass and if you look angry or offer to frown with my darling shillelah ill knock you down chorus says barney magee unto me by the hokey i love biddy brown and before ill give her up to thee one or both of us will go down chorus so with my darling shillelah i gave him a whack which left him lying on his back saying botheration to you and biddy brown for im the rattling boy from dublin town chorus so a policeman chanced to come up at the time and he asked of me the cause of the shine says i he threatened to knock me down when i challenged him for walking with my biddy brown chorus so the policeman took barney magee to jail which made him shout and bewail that ever he met with biddy brown the greatest deceiver in dublin town chorus so i bade farewell to biddy brown the greatest jilter in dublin town because she proved untrue to me and was going about with barney magee chorus in aesops tales an honest wretch we find whose years and comforts equally declined he in two wives had two domestic ills for different age they had and different wills one plucked his black hairs out and one his gray the man for quietness did both obey till all his parish saw his head quite bare and thought he wanted brains as well as hair the moral the parties henpecked william are thy wives the hairs they pluck are thy prerogatives tories thy person hate the whigs thy power though much thou yieldest still they tug for more till this poor man and thou alike are shown he without hair and thou without a crown she visits still too much dressed in aromasof fir needles mango mold i still get lostknowing shes close me not getting youngeror more conscious sometimes i fantasticateim broad awake her witchy presence waitsfor me to jump into her arms but then shes just an incoherent ache in sleeps freaked scenes i feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wrists vaporing nooses around my head and feetand genitals conjuring my drab hair into a party bowl of oiled desirable locks she makes me nervous but what would i dowithout her so long as i cant have her i want her and this alarming manic frequency then again who wants to wake to change its pulped smelly suit of meat drawing flies my night watch hot girl moon maiden mom let me get just one nights sleep without regret released from your foxy ticklish fondlings your latest smell of windblown fresh cut grass all my past life is mine no more the flying hours are gone like transitory dreams givn oer whose images are kept in store by memory alone the time that is to come is not how can it then be mine the present moments all my lot and that as fast as it is got phyllis is only thine then talk not of inconstancy false hearts and broken vows if i by miracle can be this live long minute true to thee tis all that heavn allows inside my lunch to my surprise a perfect heart shaped love note lies the outside says will you be mine and will you be my valentine i take it out and wonder who would want to tell me i love you perhaps a girl whos much too shy to hand it to me eye to eye or maybe it was sweetly penned in private by a secret friend who found my lunchbox sitting by and slid the note in on the sly oh id be thrilled if it were jo the cute one in the second row or could it be from jennifer has she found out im sweet on her my minds abuzz my shoulders tense i need no more of this suspense my stomach lurching in my throat i open up my little note then wham as if it were a bomb inside it reads i love you mom katherine katherine katherine katherine black hair small cold eyes whom you loved cock tease katherine chewer of souls the door blew open and she blew in a ghoul black air small cold wind taking everything fish eater katherine whose nails dig blood im going to call her pinch cunt pickle lip piss dribble shit smear goats meat breath i want to throw stones at her mothers corpse send her children to name change foster homes may the coat she is wearing burst into flames and boil the flesh blistering off her bones may she be refused in both heaven and hell and wander the earth forever without rest a hungry ghost clinging to the rocks and trees when you said no i went for your dresser opened the top drawer broke the paper seals on the two sterile cups and wiped my dirty thumbs inside because our stubborn love wont die i have to kill it will it dead or so i thought until i passed a cycle on my own youve no idea whats grown inside me since i bled full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with all triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath maskd him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth years later they find themselves talking about chances moments when their lives might have swerved off for the smallest reason what if i hadnt phoned he says that morning what if youd been out as you were when i tried three times the night before then she tells him a secret shed been there all evening and she knew he was the one calling which was why she hadnt answered because she felt because she was certain her life would change if she picked up the phone said hello said i was just thinking of you i was afraid she tells him and in the morning i also knew it was you but i just answered the phone the way anyone answers a phone when it starts to ring not thinking you have a choice she left me at the silent time when the moon had ceasd to climb the azure path of heavens steep and like an albatross asleep balancd on her wings of light hoverd in the purple night ere she sought her ocean nest in the chambers of the west she left me and i stayd alone thinking over every tone which though silent to the ear the enchanted heart could hear like notes which die when born but still haunt the echoes of the hill and feeling ever oh too much the soft vibration of her touch as if her gentle hand even now lightly trembled on my brow and thus although she absent were memory gave me all of her that even fancy dares to claim her presence had made weak and tame all passions and i lived alone in the time which is our own the past and future were forgot as they had been and would be not but soon the guardian angel gone the daemon reassumd his throne in my faint heart i dare not speak my thoughts but thus disturbd and weak i sat and saw the vessels glide over the ocean bright and wide like spirit winged chariots sent oer some serenest element for ministrations strange and far as if to some elysian star sailed for drink to medicine such sweet and bitter pain as mine and the wind that wingd their flight from the land came fresh and light and the scent of winged flowers and the coolness of the hours of dew and sweet warmth left by day were scatterd oer the twinkling bay and the fisher with his lamp and spear about the low rocks damp crept and struck the fish which came to worship the delusive flame too happy they whose pleasure sought extinguishes all sense and thought of the regret that pleasure leaves destroying life alone not peace i have lost and lately these many dainty mistresses stately julia prime of all sappho next a principal smooth anthea for a skin white and heaven like crystalline sweet electra and the choice myrrha for the lute and voice next corinna for her wit and the graceful use of it with perilla all are gone only herricks left alone for to number sorrow by their departures hence and die love in fantastic triumph sat whilst bleeding hearts around him flowed for whom fresh pains he did create and strange tyrannic power he showed from thy bright eyes he took his fire which round about in sport he hurled but twas from mine he took desire enough to undo the amorous world from me he took his sighs and tears from thee his pride and cruelty from me his languishments and fears and every killing dart from thee thus thou and i the god have armed and set him up a deity but my poor heart alone is harmed whilst thine the victor is and free tired of walking and checking the lines of the tourist train that trundles through this town famous for its pottery and brackish dune pools once visited by st george and his dragon and the lady with her unicorn i stopped by at a convenient place to sit and shuck my sweet corn and let the local men hang their gates from my eyes all they could offer were other versions of myself soft and sweaty sick of the big car diet dished up by detroit and the cocktail party and locker room chatter ive had to tackle while touring this countrys musky beaches choosing to drive to my next stop i found perched upon a tall chalk cliff the statue of a broad bodied chaser so large i could never easily handle him as a top hed been added on to so many times over the centuries that it was only really possible to identify him by touch a little more shy perhaps than other guys his age an abstract clock face jutting from the pack i could feel buckled around his waist and such wee wee nuts he could only be named i whispered patience i camped there in his shadow til noon the next day and drove away leaving a few of my burnt bones there behind all that has tamed me i have learned to love and lost that wildness that was once beloved all that was loved ive learned to tame and lost the beloved that once was wild all that is wild is tamed by love and the beloved wildness that once was loved i will make you brooches and toys for your delight of bird song at morning and star shine at night i will make a palace fit for you and me of green days in forests and blue days at sea i will make my kitchen and you shall keep your room where white flows the river and bright blows the broom and you shall wash your linen and keep your body white in rainfall at morning and dewfall at night and this shall be for music when no one else is near the fine song for singing the rare song to hear that only i remember that only you admire of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire she sat on his lap for hours pressed his face to her large pink breasts her hands moved through his hair like fond snakesshe gave him curls cleft hooves beneath the flesh marvellous flesh and smooth shouldersshe taught him how to use his tongue to shape a heart from a piece of ice two loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman coloured ill to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride and whether that my angel be turnd fiend suspect i may yet not directly tell but being both from me both to each friend i guess one angel in anothers hell yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt till my bad angel fire my good one out before you i was living on an island and all around the seas of that lonely coast cast up their imitation jewels cast their fables and enigmas questioning sly i never solved them or ever even heard being perfect in innocence unconscious of self such ignorance of history was all my wealth a geographer sleeping in the shadow of virgins but though my maps were made of private countries i was a foreigner in all of them after you had come for when you spoke it was with a human tongue and never understood by my land locked gentry then did the sun shake down a million bells and birds bloom on bough in wildest song phlegmatic hills went shivering with flame the chestnut trees were manic at their deepest boles it is little strange that nature was riven in her frame at this second creation known to every lover how we are shaped and shape ourselves in the desires of the other within the tolerance of human change out of the springs innocence this revolution created on a kiss announced the second season the summer of private history of growth through whose sweet sessions the trees lift toward the sun each leaf a revelation our bodies coupled in the moonlights album proclaimed our love against the outlaw times whose signature was written in the burning towns your face against the night was my medallion your coming forth aroused unlikely trumpets in the once tame heart they heralded your worth who are my lodestar my bright and ultimate north marrying all points of my personal compass this is the love that now invents my fear which nuzzles me like a puppy each violent day it is poor comfort that the mind comes saying what is one slim girl to the peoples wars still my dice are loaded having had such luck having your love my life would still be whole though i should die tomorrow i have lived it all and love is never love that cannot give love up but what lovers we were what lovers even when it was all over the bull black deadweight wines that we swung towards each other rang and rang like bells of blood our own great hearts we slung the drunk boat out of port and watched our sober unreal life unmoor a continent of grief the candlelight strange on our faces like the tiny silent blazes and coruscations of its wars we blew them out and took the stairs into the night for the nights work stripped off in the timbered dark gently hooked each other on like aqualungs and thundered down to mine our lovely secret wreck we surfaced later breathless back to back and made our way alone up the mined beach of the dawn the man i love most says one day he will take a ballpoint pen and connect the stars across this freckled scoop of chest and milky way well cross the slope of pale belly and name the new constellation after a god who shows people all the places they might shine the ache of marriage thigh and tongue beloved are heavy with it it throbs in the teeth we look for communion and are turned away beloved each and each it is leviathan and we in its belly looking for joy some joy not to be known outside it two by two in the ark of the ache of it one day i wrote her name upon the strand but came the waves and washed it away again i wrote it with a second hand but came the tide and made my pains his prey vain man said she that dost in vain assay a mortal thing so to immortalize for i myself shall like to this decay and eke my name be wiped out likewise not so quod i let baser things devise to die in dust but you shall live by fame my verse your vertues rare shall eternize and in the heavens write your glorious name where whenas death shall all the world subdue our love shall live and later life renew i that was i you heard last night when there rose no moon at all nor to pierce the strained and tight tent of heaven a planet small life was dead and so was light ii not a twinkle from the fly not a glimmer from the worm when the crickets stopped their cry when the owls forbore a term you heard music that was i iii earth turned in her sleep with pain sultrily suspired for proof in at heaven and out again lightning where it broke the roof bloodlike some few drops of rain iv what they could my words expressed o my love my all my one singing helped the verses best and when singings best was done to my lute i left the rest v so wore night the east was gray white the broad faced hemlock flowers there would be another day ere its first of heavy hours found me i had passed away vi what became of all the hopes words and song and lute as well say this struck you when life gropes feebly for the path where fell light last on the evening slopes vii one friend in that path shall be to secure my step from wrong one to count night day for me patient through the watches long serving most with none to see viii never say as something bodes so the worst has yet a worse when life halts neath double loads better the taskmasters curse than such music on the roads ix when no moon succeeds the sun nor can pierce the midnights tent any star the smallest one while some drops where lightning rent show the final storm begun x when the fire fly hides its spot when the garden voices fail in the darkness thick and hot shall another voice avail that shape be where these are not xi has some plague a longer lease proffering its help uncouth cant one even die in peace as one shuts ones eyes on youth is that face the last one sees xii oh how dark your villa was windows fast and obdurate how the garden grudged me grass where i stood the iron gate ground its teeth to let me pass we barge out of the womb with two of them eyes ears arms hands legs feet only one heart not a good plan god should know we need at least a dozen a bakers dozen of hearts they break like easter eggs hidden in the grass stepped on and smashed my own heart is patched bandaged taped barely the same shape it once was when it beat fast for you tell me not sweet i am unkind that from the nunnery of thy chaste breast and quiet mind to war and arms i fly true a new mistress now i chase the first foe in the field and with a stronger faith embrace a sword a horse a shield yet this inconstancy is such as you too shall adore i could not love thee dear so much lovd i not honour more no more my dear no more these counsels try oh give my passions leave to run their race let fortune lay on me her worst disgrace let folk oerchargd with brain against me cry let clouds bedim my face break in mine eye let me no steps but of lost labour trace let all the earth with scorn recount my case but do not will me from my love to fly i do not envy aristotles wit nor do aspire to caesars bleeding fame nor aught do care though some above me sit nor hope nor wish another course to frame but that which once may win thy cruel heart thou art my wit and thou my virtue art when thou must home to shades of underground and there arrivd a new admired guest the beauteous spirits do engirt thee round white iope blithe helen and the rest to hear the stories of thy finishd love from that smooth tongue whose music hell can move then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights of masques and revels which sweet youth did make of tourneys and great challenges of knights and all these triumphs for thy beautys sake when thou hast told these honours done to thee then tell o tell how thou didst murder me take oh take those lips away that so sweetly were forsworn and those eyes like break of day lights that do mislead the morn but my kisses bring again seals of love though sealed in vain hide oh hide those hills of snow which thy frozen bosom bears on whose tops the pinks that grow are of those that april wears but first set my poor heart free bound in those icy chains by thee febrile body i woke into nightsweats stink of the toil of living where hands could not bear to approach me the young man fingered lay upon me was himself a cool sponge drew my perspiration to his lips ice chips he held in his teeth he pushed small bergs into my mouth caressed the skeletal arms ive hidden in long sleeves kissed neck and chest belly rotten with pudgy organs thick set flesh he pressed against me cock on cock and tongue against tongue saw his reflection in my marshy eyes and did not flinch such weakness held sustained by this capable stroke boatswain of my crossing i take the death im moored to announced as a measureless promontory and bob in the river like a bloated corpse blue lips vacant gaze i let the water fill my lungs until they rip their festive pi atas because the one who comes to gather me capricious angel has a voice that affirms me rising when this fever abates for haines eason imagine a child from virginia or new hampshire alone on the prairie eighty years ago or more one afternoon the shaggy pelt of grasses for the first time in that childs life flowing for miles imagine the moving shadow of a cloud far off across that shadeless ocean the obliterating strangeness like a tide that pulls or empties the bubble of the childs imaginary heart no hills no trees the childs heart lightens tending like a bubble towards the currents of the grass and sky the pure potential of the clear blank spaces or imagine the child in a draw that holds a garden cupped from the limitless motion of the prairie head resting against a pumpkin in evening sun ground cherry bushes grow along the furrows the fruit red under its papery moth shaped sheath grasshoppers tumble among the vines as large as dragons in the crumbs of pale dry earth the ground is warm to the childs cheek and the wind is a humming sound in the grass above the draw rippling the shadows of the red green blades the bubble of the childs heart melts a little because the quiet of that air and earth is like the shadow of a peaceful death limitless and potential a kind of space where one dissolves to become a part of something entire whether of sun and air or goodness and knowledge it does not matter to the child dissolved among the particles of the garden or into the motion of the grass and air imagine the child happy to be a thing imagine then that on that same wide prairie some people are threshing in the terrible heat with horses and machines cutting bands and shoveling amid the clatter of the threshers the chaff in prickly clouds and the naked sun burning as if it could set the chaff on fire imagine that the people are swedes or germans some of them resting pressed against the strawstacks trying to get the meager shade a man a tramp comes laboring across the stubble like a mirage against that blank horizon laboring in his torn shoes toward the tall mirage like images of the tilted threshers clattering in the heat because the swedes or germans have no beer or else because they cannot speak his language properly or for some reason one cannot imagine the man climbs up on a thresher and cuts bands a minute or two then waves to one of the people a young girl or a child and jumps head first into the sucking mouth of the machine where he is wedged and beat and cut to pieces while the people shout and run in the clouds of chaff like lost mirages on the pelt of prairie the obliterating strangeness and the spaces are as hard to imagine as the love of death which is the love of an entire strangeness the contagious blankness of a quiet plain imagine that a man who had seen a prairie should write a poem about a dark or shadow that seemed to be both his and the prairies as if the shadow proved that he was not a man but something that lived in quiet like the grass imagine that the man who writes that poem stunned by the loneliness of that wide pelt should prove to himself that he was like a shadow or like an animal living in the dark in the dark proof he finds in his poem the man might come to think of himself as the very prairie the sod itself not lonely and immune to death none of this happens precisely as i try to imagine that it does in the empty plains and yet it happens in the imagination of part of the country not in any place more than another on the map but rather like a place where you and i have never been and need to try to imagine place like a prairie where immigrants in the obliterating strangeness thirst for the wide contagion of the shadow or prairie where you and i with our other ways more like the cities or the hills or trees less like the clear blank spaces with their potential are like strangers in a place we must imagine joy of my life full oft for loving you i bless my lot that was so lucky placed but then the more your own mishap i rue that are so much by so mean love embased for had the equal heavens so much you graced in this as in the rest ye might invent some heavenly wit whose verse could have enchased your glorious name in golden monument but since ye deignd so goodly to relent to me your thrall in whom is little worth that little that i am shall all be spent in setting your immortal praises forth whose lofty argument uplifting me shall lift you up unto an high degree he marked the page with a matchand fell asleep in mid kiss while i a queen beein a disturbed hive stay up and buzz half a kingdom for a honey drop half a lifetime for a tender word his face half turned half past midnight half past one as we sat at the feet of the string quartet in their living room on a winter night through the hardwood floor spurts and gulps and tips and shudders came up and the candle scent air was thick alive with pearwood ebony spruce poplar and horse howled and cat skreeled and then when the gr sse fugue was around us under us over us in us i felt i was hearing the genes of my birth family pulled keening and grieving and scathing along each other scraping and craving i felt myself held in that woods of hating longing and i knew and knew myself and my parents and their parents there and then at a distance i sensed as if it were thirty years ago a being far off yet oblique approaching straying toward and then not toward and then toward this place like a wandering dreaming herdsman my husband and i almost wanted to warn him away to call out to him to go back whence he came into some calmer life but his beauty was too moving to me and i wanted too much to not be alone in the covert any more and so i prayed him come to me i bid him hasten and good welcome i there has never been sunlight for this love like a crazed flower it buds in the dark is at once a crown of thorns and a spring garland around the temples a fire a wound the bitterest of fruit but a breeze as well a source of water your breath a bite to the soul your chest a tree trunk in the current make me walk on the turbid waters be the ax that breaks this lock the dew that weeps from trees if i become mute kissing your thighs its that my heart eagerly searches your flesh for a new dawn it lies not in our power to love or hate for will in us is overruled by fate when two are stripped long ere the course begin we wish that one should lose the other win and one especially do we affect of two gold ingots like in each respect the reason no man knows let it suffice what we behold is censured by our eyes where both deliberate the love is slight who ever loved that loved not at first sight i its odd to have a separate month it escapes the year it is not only cold it is warm and loving like a death grip on a willing knee the indians have a name for it they call it summer the tepees shake in the blast like roosters at dawn everything is special to them the colorful ones ii somehow the housewife does not seem gentle is she angry because her husband likes october is it snow bleeds softly from her shoes the nest eggs have captured her but april rises from her bed iii the beggars are upon us cried chester three strangers appeared at the door demanding ribbons the october wind nests iv why do i think october is beautiful it is not is not beautiful but then what is there to hold ones interest between the various drifts of a days work but to search out the differences the window and grate but it is not is not beautiful v i think your face is beautiful the way it is close to my face and i think you are the real october with your transparence and the

freeze all the shards of ice crumpling up the banks what survives in the ignorance play it away be ceremony be a lit candle to what blows you outside the sun gives a favorite present mountain nests in ironic meadows otter takes off her shoes the small hands of her feet reaching reaching still far away people are dying crisp one dollar bills fold another life you taught me to care in the moment carve day into light or something moving in the west that doesnt destroy us look again in the coming summer the cruelest month alive still eats up the hours regret is an uneven hand a rough palm at the cheek tender and calloused i drink another glass of water turn on the tap for what grows for you for what lasts for the last and the first found thought of you ask me no more where jove bestows when june is past the fading rose for in your beautys orient deep these flowers as in their causes sleep ask me no more whither doth stray the golden atoms of the day for in pure love heaven did prepare those powders to enrich your hair ask me no more whither doth haste the nightingale when may is past for in your sweet dividing throat she winters and keeps warm her note ask me no more where those stars light that downwards fall in dead of night for in your eyes they sit and there fixed become as in their sphere ask me no more if east or west the phoenix builds her spicy nest for unto you at last she flies and in your fragrant bosom dies the mountain road ends here broken away in the chasm where the bridge washed out years ago the first scarlet larkspur glitters in the first patch of april morning sunlight the engorged creek roars and rustles like a military ball here by the waterfall insuperable life flushed with the equinox sentient and sentimental falls away to the sea and death the tissue of sympathy and agony that binds the flesh in its nessus shirt the clotted cobweb of unself and self sheds itself and flecks the suns bed with darts of blossom like flagellant blood above the water bursting in the vibrant air this ego bound by personal tragedy and the vast impersonal vindictiveness of the ruined and ruining world pauses in this immortality as passionate as apathetic as the lava flow that burned here once and stopped here and said this far and no further and spoke thereafter in the simple diction of stone naked in the warm april air we lie under the redwoods in the sunny lee of a cliff as you kneel above me i see tiny red marks on your flanks like bites where the redwood cones have pressed into your flesh you can find just the same marks in the lignite in the cliff over our heads sequoia langsdorfii before the ice and sempervirens afterwards there is little difference except for all those years here in the sweet moribund fetor of spring flowers washed flotsam and jetsam together cool and naked together under this tree for a moment we have escaped the bitterness of love and love lost and love betrayed and what might have been and what might be fall equally away with what is and leave only these ideograms printed on the immortal hydrocarbons of flesh and stone on nights when the moon seems impenetrable a locked porthole to space when the householder bars his windows and doors and his dog lies until dawn one jeweled eye open when the maiden sleeps with her rosy knees sealed tightly together on such nights the safecracker sets to work axe chisel nitroglycerin within the vault lie forty thousand tons of gold the heaped up spoils of ali babas cave the secrets of the molecule he sands his fingertips to feel the subtle vibrations of wheel lining up just so with wheel his toolmarks are his fingerprints and now a crack appears on the side of the egg a single fault line and within the golden yolk just waiting a kind of wind a door flies open a glitter of forsythia forced out of the branch with smoothest fingertips you touch the locked cage of my ribs just so my knees fall open and cleopatra smiles whose own egyptians first invented the lock cold in the earth and the deep snow piled above thee far far removed cold in the dreary grave have i forgot my only love to love thee severed at last by times all severing wave now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover over the mountains on that northern shore resting their wings where heath and fern leaves cover thy noble heart forever ever more cold in the earth and fifteen wild decembers from those brown hills have melted into spring faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers after such years of change and suffering sweet love of youth forgive if i forget thee while the worlds tide is bearing me along other desires and other hopes beset me hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong no later light has lightened up my heaven no second morn has ever shone for me all my lifes bliss from thy dear life was given all my lifes bliss is in the grave with thee but when the days of golden dreams had perished and even despair was powerless to destroy then did i learn how existence could be cherished strengthened and fed without the aid of joy then did i check the tears of useless passion weaned my young soul from yearning after thine sternly denied its burning wish to hasten down to that tomb already more than mine and even yet i dare not let it languish dare not indulge in memorys rapturous pain once drinking deep of that divinest anguish how could i seek the empty world again i take off my shirt i show you i shaved the hair out under my arms i roll up my pants i scraped off the hair on my legs with a knife getting white my hair is the color of chopped maples my eyes dark as beans cooked in the south coal fields in the moon on torn up hills skin polished as a ming bowl showing its blood cracks its age i have hundreds of names for the snow for this all of them quiet in the night i come to you and it seems a shame to waste my deepest shudders on a wall of a man you recognize strangers think you lived through destruction you cant explain this night my face your memory you want to know what i know your own hands are lying love lives beyond the tomb the earth which fades like dew i love the fond the faithful and the true love lives in sleep tis happiness of healthy dreams eves dews may weep but love delightful seems tis seen in flowers and in the evens pearly dew on earths green hours and in the heavens eternal blue tis heard in spring when light and sunbeams warm and kind on angels wing bring love and music to the wind and where is voice so young so beautiful and sweet as natures choice where spring and lovers meet love lives beyond the tomb the earth the flowers and dew i love the fond the faithful young and true its no use mother dear i cant finish my weaving you may blame aphrodite soft as she is she has almost killed me with love for that boy white people leave the express at th street collectively like pigeons from a live wire or hope from the hearts of harlem and im one of them although my lover sleeps two stops north between malcolm x and adam clayton powell boulevards wishing my ass were cupped inside her knees and belly wishing this in a dream thick with inequalities i live on riverside drive my face helped get me here i was ruddy with anticipation the day i interviewed for the rooms near the park with its snow covered maples i was full of undisguised hope as i strolled along the river believing i belonged there that my people inherited this wonderland unequivocally as if they deserved it my lover buys twinkies from the arabs bootleg tapes on th and carries a blade in her back pocket although her hands are the gentlest ive known she ignores the piss smells on the corner the sirens at a m the men whose brains have dissolved in rum and tries to trust a white woman who sleeps near the trees of riverside when we go out together we avoid expensive caf s on columbus avenue jaunts to the upper east side harlem eyes us suspiciously or with contempt beneath half closed lids we have friends there hidden in the ruins like gold who accept us when it snows we walk boldly anywhere as if the snow were a protection or a death meanwhile the sea moves uneasily like a man who suspects what the room reels with as he rises into it is violation his own he touches the bruises at each shoulder and on his chest the larger bruise star shaped a flawed star or hand though he remembers no hands has tried cant remember that kind of rhythm to it even to the roughest surf theres a rhythm findable which is why we keep coming here to find it or thats what we say we dive in and as usual the swimming feels like that swimming the mind does in the wake of transgression how the instinct to panic at first slackens that much more quickly if you dont look back regret like pity changes nothing really we say to ourselves and less often to each other each time swimming a bit farther leaving the shore the way the water in its own watered of course version of semaphore keeps leaving the subject out flashingwhy should it matter now and why why shouldn t it as the waves beat harder hard against us until thats how we like it ill break your heart break mine of what sins have you made confession here ardent cecile not passions intimacy or tangles of desire that mutineera bold way through your maiden ecstasy those are not blamed the penance not severe pray rather with cool lidded conscious eyesfor warm juvescence of those ichored limbs for laughter checked by no repentant cries for lips unstained by pattering of hymns mens glances have embraced you they are wise they have seen you cumbent by the ruddy fire lending your curves to cushioned wantonness or leaping to the stroke of an earthy lyretwanged in the joy of throbbing noons excessand cried no pause for love you they require of what sins have you made confession here ardent cecile the wood receives your knees the organ stirs your prayer now you reverethe god that made you beautiful among these the gnarled and ugly your book receives no tear i scarce believe my love to be so pure as i had thought it was because it doth endure vicissitude and season as the grass methinks i lied all winter when i swore my love was infinite if spring make it more but if medicine love which cures all sorrow with more not only be no quintessence but mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense and of the sun his working vigor borrow loves not so pure and abstract as they use to say which have no mistress but their muse but as all else being elemented too love sometimes would contemplate sometimes do and yet no greater but more eminent love by the spring is grown as in the firmament stars by the sun are not enlarged but shown gentle love deeds as blossoms on a bough from loves awakened root do bud out now if as water stirred more circles be produced by one love such additions take those like so many spheres but one heaven make for they are all concentric unto thee and though each spring do add to love new heat as princes do in time of action get new taxes and remit them not in peace no winter shall abate the springs increase for love i would split open your head and put a candle in behind the eyes love is dead in us if we forget the virtues of an amulet and quick surprise womanhood wanton ye want your meddling mistress is mannerless plenty of ill of goodness scant ye rail at riot reckless to praise your port it is needless for all your draff yet and your dregs as well borne as ye full oft time begs why so coy and full of scorn mine horse is sold i ween you say my new furr d gown when it is worn put up your purse ye shall not pay by crede i trust to see the day as proud a pea hen as ye spread of me and other ye may have need though angelic be your smiling yet is your tongue an adders tail full like a scorpion stinging all those by whom ye have avail good mistress anne there ye do shail what prate ye pretty pigesnye i trust to quite you ere i die your key is meet for every lock your key is common and hangeth out your key is ready we need not knock nor stand long wresting there about of your door gate ye have no doubt but one thing is that ye be lewd hold your tongue now all beshrewd to mistress anne that farly sweet that wones at the key in thames street because i love you and beneath the uncountable stars i have become the delicate piston threading itself through your chest i want to tell you a story i shouldnt but will and in the meantime neglect love the discordant melody spilling from my ears but attend instead to this tale for a river burns inside my mouth and it wants both purgation and to eternally sip your thousand drippings and in the story is a dog and unnamed it leads to less heartbreak so name him max and in the story are neighborhood kids who spin a yarn about max like im singing to you except they tell a child a boy who only moments earlier had been wending through sticker bushes to pick juicy rubies whose chin was in fact stained with them and combining in their story the big kids make the boy who shall remain unnamed believe max to be sick and rabid and say his limp and regular smell of piss are just two signs but the worst of it they say is that hell likely find you in the night and the big kids do not giggle and the boy does not giggle but lets the final berries in his hand drop into the overgrowth at his feet and if i spoke the dream of the unnamed boy i fear my tongue would turn an arm of fire so i wont but know inside the boys head grew a fire beneath the same stars as you and i love your leg between mine the fine hairs on your upper thigh nearly glistening in the night and the boy the night the incalculable mysteries as he sleeps with a stuffed animal tucked beneath his chin and rolls tight against his brother in their shared bed who rolls away and you know by now there is no salve to quell his minds roaring machinery and i shouldnt tell you but i will the unnamed boy on the third night of the dreams which harden his soft face puts on pants and a sweatshirt and quietly takes the spade from the den and more quietly leaves his house where upstairs his father lies dreamless and his mother bends her body into his and beneath these same stars love which often when i study them seem to recede like so many of the lies of light the boy walks to the yard where max lives attached to a steel cable spanning the lawn and the boy brings hot dogs which he learned from tom jerry and nearly urinating in his pants he tosses them toward the quiet and crippled thing limping across the lawn the cable whispering above the dew slick grass and max whimpers and the boy sees a wolf where stands this ratty and sad and groveling dog and beneath these very stars max raises his head to look at the unnamed boy with one glaucous eye nearly glued shut and the other wet from the cool breeze and wheezing max catches the gaze of the boy who sees at last the raw skin on the dogs flank the quiver of his spindly legs and as max bends his nose to the franks the boy watches him struggle to snatch the meat with gums and bringing the shovel down he bends to lift the meat to maxs toothless mouth and rubs the length of his throat and chin max arching his neck with his eyes closed now and licking the boys round face until the boy unchains the dog and stands taking slow steps backward through the wet grass and feels for the first time in days the breath in his lungs which is cool and a little damp spilling over his small lips and he feels again his feet beneath him and the earth beneath them and starlings singing the morning in and the somber movement of beetles chewing the leaves of the white birch glinting in the dark and he notices darling an upturned nest beneath the tree and flips it looking for the blue eggs of robins but finds none and placing a rumpled crimson feather in his mouth slips the spindly thicket into another tree which he climbs to watch the first hint of light glancing above the fields and the boy eventually returns to his thorny fruit bush where an occasional prick leaves on his arm or leg a spot of blood the color of these raspberries and tasting of salt and filling his upturned shirt with them he beams that he could pull from the earth that which might make you smile love which youll find in the fridge on the bottom shelf behind the milk in the bowl you made with your own lovely hands i wanted to see where beauty comes from without you in the world hauling my heart across sixty acres of northeast meadow my pockets filling with flowers then i remembered its you i miss in the brightness and body of every living name rattlebox yarrow wild vetch you are the green wonder of june root and quasar the thirst for salt when i finally understand that people fail at love what is left but cinquefoil thistle the paper wings of the dragonfly aeroplaning the soul with a sudden blue hilarity if i get the story right desire is continuous equatorial there is still so much i want to know what you believe can never be removed from us what you dreamed on walnut street in the unanswerable dark of your childhood learning pleasure on your own tell me our story are we impetuous are we kind to each other do we surrender to what the mind cannot think past where is the evidence i will learn to be good at loving the black dog orbits the horseshoe pond for treefrogs in their plangent emergencies there are violet hills there is the covenant of duskbirds the moon comes over the mountain like a big peach and i want to tell you what i couldnt say the night we rushed north how i love the seriousness of your fingers and the way you go into yourself calling my half name like a secret i stand between taproot and treespire here is the compass rose to help me live through this here are twelve ways of knowing what blooms even in the blindness of such longing yellow oxeye vipers bugloss with its set of pink arms pleading do not forget me we hunger for eloquence we measure the isopleths i am visiting my life with reckless plenitude the air is fragrant with tiny strawberries fireflies turn on their electric wills an effulgence let me come back whole let me remember how to touch you before it is too late for i can snore like a bullhorn or play loud music or sit up talking with any reasonably sober irishman and fergus will only sink deeper into his dreamless sleep which goes by all in one flash but let there be that heavy breathing or a stifled come cry anywhere in the house and he will wrench himself awake and make for it on the run as now we lie together after making love quiet touching along the length of our bodies familiar touch of the long married and he appears in his baseball pajamas it happens the neck opening so small he has to screw them on and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child in the half darkness we look at each other and smile and touch arms across this little startlingly muscled body this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake this blessing love gives again into our arms weeks after ice out last falls leaves make a pathway to the lake radiant blue and still deathly cold i press my hot forehead to the window smudging it blow and the glass steams as if looking at a photo through parchment im detached the way i saw his body in the cat scan from a foggy distance id like to open the window release a wounded bird nursed to health wiping the glass with my sleeve i see white pelicans wheel and flash in the sky in different cities on different forms of transportation a woman read daniel deronda until the year became the arbitrary pink the calendar chose for the middle of winter and finally she sat in the reference section of the public library finishing daniel deronda for days at a slowing pace between piecesof newspapers and foreign language newspaperswhose syntax she enjoyed not understanding and when she didnt anymore she wrote in the marginsof daniel deronda for someonewho might never see thought of that personwho might never see staring equally at the rain equallythinking of her and of nothing in particular outside the news fell apart if one choosesto be shallow or noble or oneis born so and if it matters translationsare appropriate when nature is dormant or when onehas nothing to say or does not knowwhat to say these are three different thingsbut sometimes they are the same it is not wrong to want nice things neitheris it wrong to want to be good or to feel thatas a physical force of pleasure daniel deronda who does not know who he is who thinks he does and goes away on a boat but the cover is a picture of a woman gambling the air warms outside the referencesection and also the rain incomprehensible news whenever a book ends silence as if a stewardship had ceased a person can feel the bones of ones hands by stretching them if love comes again know better than to speak when the first dark had fallen around them and the leaves were weary of praise in the clear silence beauty found them and shewed them all her ways in the high noon of the heavenly garden where the angels sunned with the birds beauty before their hearts could harden had taught them heavenly words when they fled in the burning weather and nothing dawned but a dream beauty fasted their hands together and cooled them at her stream and when day wearied and night grew stronger and they slept as the beautiful must then she bided a little longer and blossomed from their dust leave go my hands let me catch breath and see let the dew fall drench either side of me clear apple leaves are soft upon that moon seen sidelong like a blossom in the tree and god ah god that day should be so soon the grass is thick and cool it lets us lie kissed upon either cheek and either eye i turn to thee as some green afternoon turns toward sunset and is loth to die ah god ah god that day should be so soon lie closer lean your face upon my side feel where the dew fell that has hardly dried hear how the blood beats that went nigh to swoon the pleasure lives there when the sense has died ah god ah god that day should be so soon o my fair lord i charge you leave me this it is not sweeter than a foolish kiss nay take it then my flower my first in june my rose so like a tender mouth it is ah god ah god that day should be so soon love till dawn sunder night from day with fire dividing my delight and my desire the crescent life and love the plenilune love me though dusk begin and dark retire ah god ah god that day should be so soon ah my heart fails my blood draws back i know when life runs over life is near to go and with the slain of love loves ways are strewn and with their blood if love will have it so ah god ah god that day should be so soon ah do thy will now slay me if thou wilt there is no building now the walls are built no quarrying now the corner stone is hewn no drinking now the vines whole blood is spilt ah god ah god that day should be so soon nay slay me now nay for i will be slain pluck thy red pleasure from the teeth of pain break down thy vine ere yet grape gatherers prune slay me ere day can slay desire again ah god ah god that day should be so soon yea with thy sweet lips with thy sweet sword yea take life and all for i will die i say love i gave love is life a better boon for sweet nights sake i will not live till day ah god ah god that day should be so soon nay i will sleep then only nay but go ah sweet too sweet to me my sweet i know love sleep and death go to the sweet same tune hold my hair fast and kiss me through it soon ah god ah god that day should be so soon five hours and who can do it less in by haughty celia spent in dressing the goddess from her chamber issues arrayed in lace brocades and tissues strephon who found the room was void and betty otherwise employed stole in and took a strict survey of all the litter as it lay whereof to make the matter clear an inventory follows here and first a dirty smock appeared beneath the armpits well besmeared strephon the rogue displayed it wide and turned it round on every side on such a point few words are best and strephon bids us guess the rest but swears how damnably the men lie in calling celia sweet and cleanly now listen while he next produces the various combs for various uses filled up with dirt so closely fixt no brush could force a way betwixt a paste of composition rare sweat dandruff powder lead and hair a forehead cloth with oil upont to smooth the wrinkles on her front here alum flower to stop the steams exhaled from sour unsavory streams there night gloves made of tripsys hide bequeathed by tripsy when she died with puppy water beautys help distilled from tripsys darling whelp here gallypots and vials placed some filled with washes some with paste some with pomatum paints and slops and ointments good for scabby chops hard by a filthy basin stands fouled with the scouring of her hands the basin takes whatever comes the scrapings of her teeth and gums a nasty compound of all hues for here she spits and here she spews but oh it turned poor strephons bowels when he beheld and smelled the towels begummed bemattered and beslimed with dirt and sweat and earwax grimed no object strephons eye escapes here petticoats in frowzy heaps nor be the handkerchiefs forgot all varnished oer with snuff and snot the stockings why should i expose stained with the marks of stinking toes or greasy coifs and pinners reeking which celia slept at least a week in a pair of tweezers next he found to pluck her brows in arches round or hairs that sink the forehead low or on her chin like bristles grow the virtues we must not let pass of celias magnifying glass when frightened strephon cast his eye ont it showed visage of a giant a glass that can to sight disclose the smallest worm in celias nose and faithfully direct her nail to squeeze it out from head to tail for catch it nicely by the head it must come out alive or dead why strephon will you tell the rest and must you needs describe the chest that careless wench no creature warn her to move it out from yonder corner but leave it standing full in sight for you to exercise your spite in vain the workman showed his wit with rings and hinges counterfeit to make it seem in this disguise a cabinet to vulgar eyes for strephon ventured to look in resolved to go through thick and thin he lifts the lid there needs no more he smelled it all the time before as from within pandoras box when epimetheus opd the locks a sudden universal crew of human evils upwards flew he still was comforted to find that hope at last remained behind so strephon lifting up the lid to view what in the chest was hid the vapors flew from out the vent but strephon cautious never meant the bottom of the pan to grope and foul his hands in search of hope o never may such vile machine be once in celias chamber seen o may she better learn to keep those secrets of the hoary deep as mutton cutlets prime of meat which though with art you salt and beat as laws of cookery require and toast them at the clearest fire if from adown the hopeful chops the fat upon a cinder drops to stinking smoke it turns the flame poisning the flesh from whence it came and up exhales a greasy stench for which you curse the careless wench so things which must not be expressed when plumped into the reeking chest send up an excremental smell to taint the parts from whence they fell the petticoats and gown perfume which waft a stink round every room thus finishing his grand survey disgusted strephon stole away repeating in his amorous fits oh celia celia celia shits but vengeance goddess never sleeping soon punished strephon for his peeping his foul imagination links each dame he sees with all her stinks and if unsavory odors fly conceives a lady standing by all women his description fits and both ideas jump like wits but vicious fancy coupled fast and still appearing in contrast i pity wretched strephon blind to all the charms of female kind should i the queen of love refuse because she rose from stinking ooze to him that looks behind the scene satiras but some pocky queen when celia in her glory shows if strephon would but stop his nose who now so impiously blasphemes her ointments daubs and paints and creams her washes slops and every clout with which he makes so foul a rout he soon would learn to think like me and bless his ravished sight to see such order from confusion sprung such gaudy tulips raised from dung on our first trip to the beach together i cut my foot on sharp rocks lining the shore and watched the ocean lick the crimson clean off the salt on my tongue a slight distraction from the deep blue the wide open the playground sting im sorry my flesh is softer than it has to be my skin thinner than yours im sorry there are parts of me i have scrubbed raw hurt i only wanted to be polished untainted good as new im sorry i didnt see the waves crashing didnt see any of this coming im sorry i wasnt careful or strong when the sea soaked up my blood that day i thought maybe it needed to drink too needed to kiss needed to need i thought maybe you had always been right when you drain my body of tears you also drain it of salt and dust so that you can shrink me down two sizes smaller and i can fit neatly into your life without taking up too much space so that you can carry me with you wherever you go to cities and mountains and valleys and all the oceans youve never explored tell me please if you find something tell me if you need me to search too tell me if there are places you still have to visit things you still have to unearth tell me if theres any way to love you deep blue and wide open soft and scrubbed and thin flesh and skin shrinking bones raw parts any way at all without letting myself bleed shallow body by caitlin hazell blindfold i should to myra run and swear to love her ever yet when the bandage was undone should only think her clever with the full usage of my eyes i chloe should decide for but when she talks i her despise whom dumb i could have died for she was a phantom of delight when first she gleamed upon my sight a lovely apparition sent to be a moments ornament her eyes as stars of twilight fair like twilights too her dusky hair but all things else about her drawn from may time and the cheerful dawn a dancing shape an image gay to haunt to startle and way lay i saw her upon nearer view a spirit yet a woman too her household motions light and free and steps of virgin liberty a countenance in which did meet sweet records promises as sweet a creature not too bright or good for human natures daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles and now i see with eye serene the very pulse of the machine a being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller between life and death the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill a perfect woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command and yet a spirit still and bright with something of angelic light i oh chimes set high on the sunny tower ring on ring on unendingly make all the hours a single hour for when the dusk begins to flower the man i love will come to me but no go slowly as you will i should not bid you hasten so for while i wait for love to come some other girl is standing dumb fearing her love will go ii oh white steam over the roofs blow high oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free oh sun awake in the covered sky for the man i love loves me oh drifting steam disperse and die oh tower stand shrouded toward the south fate heard afar my happy cry and laid her finger on my mouth iii the dusk was blue with blowing mist the lights were spangles in a veil and from the clamor far below floated faint music like a wail it voiced what i shall never speak my heart was breaking all night long but when the dawn was hard and gray my tears distilled into a song iv i said i have shut my heart as one shuts an open door that love may starve therein and trouble me no more but over the roofs there came the wet new wind of may and a tune blew up from the curb where the street pianos play my room was white with the sun and love cried out to me i am strong i will break your heart unless you set me free let it not your wonder move less your laughter that i love though i now write fifty years i have had and have my peers poets though divine are men some have lovd as old again and it is not always face clothes or fortune gives the grace or the feature or the youth but the language and the truth with the ardour and the passion gives the lover weight and fashion if you then will read the story first prepare you to be sorry that you never knew till now either whom to love or how but be glad as soon with me when you know that this is she of whose beauty it was sung she shall make the old man young keep the middle age at stay and let nothing high decay till she be the reason why all the world for love may die of this worlds theatre in which we stay my love lyke the spectator ydly sits beholding me that all the pageants play disguysing diversly my troubled wits sometimes i joy when glad occasion fits and mask in myrth lyke to a comedy soone after when my joy to sorrow flits i waile and make my woes a tragedy yet she beholding me with constant eye delights not in my merth nor rues my smart but when i laugh she mocks and when i cry she laughes and hardens evermore her hart what then can move her if not merth nor mone she is no woman but a sencelesse stone when i found your face on a pillow of leaves you had already erased it a nest so heavy can stay in the heavens only by reversal by this law the knees are laced with abandon i said to the young man if watching is the manufacturer and i lose you what angel takes the place of a dowry or distance in this leaf action subject to like passions as we are my soul herself myself a possession i could not mistake for the man his language and latin yet we are taken to a love passage i had hardly noticed in the late talk of money the work of love and the work of art has no sleeping part is a drop of light in a small silver socket a rosy dime in a daylight tryst is a keeper and no spender as seeing who is invisible a kind of flaxen thing caught in stone i obeyed and read further i am hemmed though my heart were a pear tree threaded with fire lion you leapt through me like fineness in the boundary gene conductor you knit me as isthmus can i touch it night is going miles an hr as usual in this way we find we are suddenly altered if i were a day would you like me better where were you you who in a bath changed mehow to be walking is a glorious porthole must i insist on an absence more foolish and secret when your timbers a forest i cant see for the tree in my bed gentle captive it is a larger than murder we tender fond and afire my style and my anchor master theres a boat for no lesser completion than beautys sweetest dress when you look on me kind who am i to stop this flowing least of all that home mile sinking in the real i dreamed there was a further island perhaps how i thought you to salt that harness with pleasure lovely hero where the lovely hero bounds an acre hidden between eros and its errors finding a dozen darts beneath the skin of watching the wire of a skinny flame no other lovely hero found the back behind her secret form of symmetry her gleaming difference her schoolish way in pretty understandings said not done not said undone wealthy sadness has a way of winning everyone this is the end of my body as you know it its superfluous penchant for love its poorer costume its shiny disaster what is a maiden boatswain but a fiery lair and a teary citadel by the smallest shipwreck a daughter is laughter yet equaled as in a fable this gibraltar goes headlong in a just kings love see how his hands are her mercy and measure her number and rescue o perseus pythagoras pierre my pierre what rules a bodys buried factions when laundered by morning when called by our names although we are invisible sleeping i forget my animal when the animal comes im forgotten because of it how was it called in its own country crossing a street in order to come inside beloved thou hast brought me many flowers plucked in the garden all the summer through and winter and it seemed as if they grew in this close room nor missed the sun and showers so in the like name of that love of ours take back these thoughts which here unfolded too and which on warm and cold days i withdrew from my hearts ground indeed those beds and bowers be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue and wait thy weeding yet heres eglantine heres ivy take them as i used to do thy flowers and keep them where they shall not pine instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true and tell thy soul their roots are left in mine when i have seen by times fell hand defacd the rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see down rasd and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watry main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose beloved men in thick green coats came crunching through the snow the insignia on their shoulders of uncertain origin a country i could not be sure of a salute so terrifying i heard myself lying to avoid arrest and was arrested along with jocko whose tear had snapped off a tiny icicle he put in his mouth we were taken to the ice prison a palace encrusted with hoarfrost its dome lit from within jocko admired the wiring he kicked the walls to test the strength of his new boots a television stood in a block of ice its blue image still moving like a liquid center you asked for my innermost thoughts i wonder will i ever see a grape again when i think of the vineyard where we met in october when you dropped a cluster custom insisted you be kissed by a stranger how after the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms turned pink it seemed our future was sealed everyone said so it is quiet here not closing our ranks weakens us hugely the snowflakes fall in a featureless bath i am the stranger who kissed you on sunny days each tree is a glittering chandelier the power of mindless beauty jocko told a joke and has been dead since may a bullethole in his forehead the officers call a third eye for a month i milked a barnful of cows it is a lot like cleansing a chandelier wipe and polish wipe and polish round and round you go i have lost my spectacles is the book i was reading still open by the side of our bed treat it as a bookmark saving my place in our story here the letter breaks off give me more love or more disdain the torrid or the frozen zone bring equal ease unto my pain the temperate affords me none either extreme of love or hate is sweeter than a calm estate give me a storm if it be love like danae in that golden showr i swim in pleasure if it prove disdain that torrent will devour my vulture hopes and hes possessd of heaven thats but from hell releasd then crown my joys or cure my pain give me more love or more disdain these lovers inklings which our loves enmesh lost to the cunning and dimensional eye though tenemented in the selves we see not more perforce than azure to the sky were necromancy juggled to the flesh and startled from no daylight you or me for trance and silvemess those moons commend which blanch the warm life silver pale or look what ghostly portent mist distorts from slight clay shapes the willows that the waters took liquid and brightened in the waters bend and we in loves reflex seemed loved of right then no more think to net forthwith loves thing but cast for it by spirit sleight of hand then only in the slant glass contemplate where lineament outstripping line is scanned then on the perplexed text leave pondering loves proverb is set down transliterate despite all their fervor they were headed somewhere limp in the intellect nursery rhyme dialect headed somewhere all circumference hunnid something for sumerian tablet happy meals where you get to munch the code cold sun upfront the rest when youve eaten a bit of rat flesh in the shape of yesterday perishing youth addiction future dreams of codeine nibbles the white nipple wedged between him and his soul stice staaay sis what is this passes out on the battlefield improviser wisest man i ever mumbled alongside power with all the wars in it aint shit in a flawed system besides

painless bled til the chains lost their grip and there are tapes to prove it love like a jugler comes to play his prise and all minds draw his wonders to admire to see how cuningly hee wanting eyes can yett deseave the best sight of desire the wanton child how hee can faine his fire so pretely as none sees his disguise how finely doe his tricks while wee fooles hire the badge and office of his

and familiar in your grandmothers hands shell come back heaven having been too far from home to hold her o it will be beautiful every girl will ask you to dance and the boys wont kill you for it shake your head dance until your bones clatter what a prize you are what a lucky sack of stars chewing slowly only after id eatenmy grandmother mother son in law two brothers in law and father in law his big family included in that order and had for dessertthe towns inhabitants did i find says kabir the beloved that ive becomeone with she dwelt among the untrodden ways beside the springs of dove a maid whom there were none to praise and very few to love a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky she lived unknown and few could know when lucy ceased to be but she is in her grave and oh the difference to me you dweller in the dark cabin to whom the watermelon is always purple whose garden is wind and moon of the two dreams night and day what lover what dreamer would choose the one obscured by sleep here is the plantain by your door and the best cock of red feather that crew before the clocks a feme may come leaf green whose coming may give revel beyond revelries of sleep yes and the blackbird spread its tail so that the sun may speckle while it creaks hail you dweller in the dark cabin rise since rising will not waken and hail cry hail cry hail i the grey sea and the long black land and the yellow half moon large and low and the startled little waves that leap in fiery ringlets from their sleep as i gain the cove with pushing prow and quench its speed i the slushy sand ii then a mile of warm sea scented beach three fields to cross till a farm appears a tap at the pane the quick sharp scratch and blue spurt of a lighted match and a voice less loud thro its joys and fears than the two hearts beating each to each when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear times waste then can i drown an eye unusd to flow for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night and weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe and moan th expense of many a vanishd sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell oer the sad account of fore bemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restord and sorrows end sweetest love i do not go for weariness of thee nor in hope the world can show a fitter love for me but since that i must die at last tis best to use myself in jest thus by feignd deaths to die yesternight the sun went hence and yet is here today he hath no desire nor sense nor half so short a way then fear not me but believe that i shall make speedier journeys since i take more wings and spurs than he o how feeble is mans power that if good fortune fall cannot add another hour nor a lost hour recall but come bad chance and we join toit our strength and we teach it art and length itself oer us toadvance when thou sighst thou sighst not wind but sighst my soul away when thou weepst unkindly kind my lifes blood doth decay it cannot be that thou lovst me as thou sayst if in thine my life thou waste that art the best of me let not thy divining heart forethink me any ill destiny may take thy part and may thy fears fulfil but think that we are but turnd aside to sleep they who one another keep alive neer parted be the man i pulled tonight carried a load of books when i felt him watching me uphill i grimaced he gave me lunar cakes the size of two camel humps when i answered him i smiled to his face he wore the moonlight in his specs pant seams clean as the embroidery work of his book covers one cannot grow rich without a bit of cleverness should i have shown him the secret of my deft touch the circling moon the graceful swan how east wind beats west wind if other two winds say so snow falls on cedars i am haunted by how much our mothers do not know how a republic falls because of its backhanded deals stairwell secrets my mother does not know i am lying with a man who is darker than me that we do not have names for how we truly treat our bodies what we do with them the other possesses me without him the perception of me fails to exist my mother now is taking her sheers and cutting through live shrimp when i was a child she peeled each flushed grape until only the pale fleshy bead remained she placed them onto a plate in one shining mound deseeded in front of me how i sucked and bled the fruit of all their juice hypnotized in front of the buzz of television in each version of my childhood i am her daughter this is certain i am lying down with a man who is darker than me and maybe this poem is my real republic my face is my face or is it stolen from my mother and hung over mine if i were a dream you could say my countenance was a string of flickering lights made of teeth or an expression unraveling like a carpet into a narrow river of another life does truth matter when its floating face up or face down the answer to this makes all the difference let the

children three that nestle near eager eye and willing ear pleased a simple tale to hear long has paled that sunny sky echoes fade and memories die autumn frosts have slain july still she haunts me phantomwise alice moving under skies never seen by waking eyes children yet the tale to hear eager eye and willing ear lovingly shall nestle near in a wonderland they lie dreaming as the days go by dreaming as the summers die ever drifting down the stream lingering in the golden gleam life what is it but a dream you gave me a white rose put the lamp on the stove it caught fire the i ching saidthunder above the lake lightning in baker street switched on the cooker and blew a fuse blue flash you see the whole experience is electric there was terror already in her love even before she knew for sure her lover was the god her forehead skidded a little on the sweat of his chest and close to his ear semele begged again for proof and it didnt feel like a myth or a metaphor to her as she burned up with the brightness she saw you are the man you are my other country and i find it hard going you are the prickly pear you are the sudden violent storm the torrent to raise the river to float the wounded doe in the road a dog days dead that dog liliana was walking beside me awhile i am sure and i was almost not crying but then found what i was looking for she heaved it for me all of it the stench the weight in her thin arms until it was too much tired she dragged the thing by its wasted paws all the way home her dress was stained this is how i learned about love she did not mind at all the silent steady distance i placed between us oh sorry hello are you on your way to work too i was just taken aback by how you also have a briefcase also small brown i was taken by how you seem secretly to love everything are you my new coworker oh i see no still good to meet you im trying out this thing where its goodto meet people maybe beyond briefcases we have some thingsin common i like jelly beans im afraid of death im afraidof farting even around people i love do you think your motherloves you when you fart does your mother love youall the time have you ever doubted i like that the street were on is named after a tree when there are none poplar or otherwise i wonder if a treehas ever been named after a street whether that worked out if i were a street i hope id get a good name not mainor one way one night i ran out of an apartment down north pleasant street it was soft neighborlywith pines oaks it felt too hopeful after what happened after my mothers lovebecame doubtful after i told her i liked a boy she wishedi had never been born after she said she was afraidof me terrified i might infect my brotherswith my abnormality sometimes parents childrenbecome the most common strangers eventually a street appears where they can meet again or not ive doubted my own love for my mother i doubt do i have to forgive in order to love or do i have to lovefor forgiveness to even be possible what do you think im trying out this thing where questions about love forgivenessare a form of work id rather not do alone im trying to say lets put our briefcases on our heads in the sudden rain continue meeting as if weve just been given our names sweet beast i have gone prowling a proud rejected man who lived along the edges catch as catch can in darkness and in hedges i sang my sour tone and all my love was howling conspicuously alone i curled and slept all day or nursed my bloodless wounds until the squares were silent where i could make my tunes singular and violent then sure as hearers came i crept and flinched away and girl youve done the same a stray from my own type led along by blindness my love was near to spoiled and curdled all my kindness i

disconsolate illiterate reader i have cleared this space for you for you for you cut back the stems an inch to keep in bloom so instructs the florists note enclosed inside the flowers who knew what was cut could heal again the green wounds close stitching themselves together it doesnt matter the flowers red and white will bloom awhile then wither you sit in an unlit room and watch the vase throw crystal shadows through the dark the flowers colors are so lovely theyre painful in a week youll have to throw them out its only hope that makes you take out scissors separate each bloom and cut where you last measured did you know venus was said to turn into a virgin each time she bathed she did it as a mark of love she did it so as to please her lovers perhaps overwhelmed by pain she eventually stopped bathing altogether it doesnt matter its a pleasure to feel the green nubs stripped watch the stems refresh under your blade theyre here because theyre beautiful they glow inside your crystal vase and yet the flowers by themselves are nothing only a refraction of color that in a week or two will be thrown out day by day the water lowers the red and white heads droop blacken at the stems it doesnt matter even cut stems heal but what is the point of pain if it heals some things should last forever instructs the florists note pleasure says one god shame says another venus heads they call these flowers in a week or two youll lose the note have to call the florist up with sympathy youll think he says perhaps with love it doesnt matter youve stopped bathing alone you sit before the crystal vase refracting you in pieces through the dark you watch the pale skin bloom inside it wither you petal inch by inch you turn red and white together i prithee spare me gentle boy press me no more for that slight toy that foolish trifle of an heart i swear it will not do its part though thou dost thine employst thy powr and art for through long custom it has known the little secrets and is grown sullen and wise will have its will and like old hawks pursues that still that makes least sport flies only wheret can kill some youth that has not made his story will think perchance the pains the glory and mannerly sit out loves feast i shall be carving of the best rudely call for the last course fore the rest and oh when once that course is past how short a time the feast doth last men rise away and scarce say grace or civilly once thank the face that did invite but seek another place since you dare brave me with a rivals name you shall prevail and i will quite my claime for know proud maid i scorn to call him mine whom thou durst ever hope to have made thine yet i confess i lovd him once so well his presence was my heavn his absence hell with genrous excellence i filld his brest and in sweet beauteous forms his person drest for him i did heaven and its powr despise and onely lived by thinfluence of his eyes i feard not rivals for i thought that he that was possessd of such a prize as me all meaner objects woud contemn and slight nor let an abject thing usurpe my right but when i heard he was so wretched base to pay devotion to thy wrinkled face i banisht him my sight and told the slave he had not worth but what my fancy gave twas i that raisd him to this glorious state and can as easily annihilate but let him live branded with guilt and shame and shrink into the shade from whence he came his punishment shall be the loss of me and be augumented by his gaining thee those scars rooted me stigmata stalagmite i sat at a drive in and watched the stars through a straw while the coke in my lap went waterier and waterier for days on end or nights no end i crawled on all fours or in my case no fours to worship you amoeba behemoth then you explained your dna calls for meaner genes than mine and since you are merely so to speak its external expression etcet ergo among your lovers ill never be ah that movie was so faraway the stars melting made my thighs icy i see its not you who is not requiting me its something in you over which you have no say says no to me lyke as the culver on the bar d bough sits mourning for the absence of her mate and in her songs sends many a wishfull vow for his returne that seemes to linger late so i alone now left disconsolate mourne to my selfe the absence of my love and wandring here and there all desolate seek with my playnts to match that mournful dove ne joy of ought that under heaven doth hove can comfort me but her owne joyous sight whose sweet asp ct both god and man can move in her unspotted pleasauns to delight dark is my day whyles her fayre light i mis and dead my life that wants such lively blis i used an arrow to kill the spider i used a steamroller to flatten the worm for the ants i called in an air strike bee that found its way in through the screen blowtorch the mammals were easier a bucket of water for submerging the cat a poisoned word thrown to the dog for love only a kitchen match that and a stove leaking gas and waiting until the dinner was good and burned tonight i started walking back to you father it was meant to be a stroll but then i started walking faster father i started chanting all the names of all the men i ever went to bed with father my thighs were burning and my feet were heavy with blood but i kept the pace and chants of names up father listed them to fence posts and the trees and didnt stop and started getting younger father and walked all night till i was home just a spark in your groin again and told you not to bring me back to life told you i repented every name and had freed them of me father love in my bosom like a bee doth suck his sweet now with his wings he plays with me now with his feet within mine eyes he makes his nest his bed

cupid so thou pity me spare not but play thee naked or not im a costume that moves figurine with a face that changes you could call me a mood i begin cheerful but sometimes turn solemn when confronted with my own mythology wolf in a cape cat scratch on a cupboard door mouse tail in the hand of a bland farmers wife a drop of blood on her shoe todays beginning ended in a dream in a fantastical bed a lover leaned in to kiss me just as i realized i was part machine part primitive urge i left the bed and said you know dont you not everyone is so disposed and then i heard from inside my head you should say not everyone is so disposed to your utopia only then did i realize id been inexact even here there are scolds that tell you how to be sometimes they live inside naked or not i am trying to tuck my arms invisibly behind my back so that all you can see are my breasts and my highly simplified head cherry lipt adonis in his snowie shape might not compare with his pure ivorie white on whose faire front a poets pen may write whose roseate red excels the crimson grape his love enticing delicate soft limbs are rarely framd tintrap poore gazine eies his cheeks the lillie and carnation dies with lovely tincture which apollos dims his lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet his mouth a hive his tongue a hony combe where muses like bees make their mansion his teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set oh how can such a body sinne procuring be slow to love and quicke to hate enduring they did the deed of darkness in their own mid light he plucked a gray field mouse suddenly in the wind the small dead fly alive helplessly in his beak his cold pride helpless all she receives is life they are terrified they touch life is too much she flies away sorrowing sorrowing she goes alone then her small falcon gone will not rise here again smaller than she he goes claw beneath claw beneath needles and leaning boughs while she the lovelier of these brief differing two floats away sorrowing tall as my love for you and almost lonelier delighted in the delighting i love you in mid air i love myself the ground the great wings sing nothing lightly lightly fall he glanced around to check if the treacherous gods had really given him the reward promised for his accomplished song and there she was eurydice restored perfectly naked and fleshed in her rhyming body again the upper and lower smiles and eyes the line of mouth sternum navel cleft the chime of breasts and hips and of the two knees the feet the toes and that expression of an unimaginable intelligence that yoked all these with a skill she herself had forgotten the learning of there she was with him once more just for an instant as she vanished and then he heard her from behind the invisible veil absence a shrill and batlike but lexical indictment why had he violated the divine command why when he had seized all song to himself and robbed her of power to open her own oblivion it grew in volume and now seemed to spew from an insane old mother with one breast hanging like a huge withered testicle from a rent in her weathered gown who was being watched by a tall woman copper helmet coiffed richly suited in salmon colour a mythical allusion since salmon were long extinct in the bays and rivers here songs never brought them anymore the young restrained breasts and the old free one oppressed him equally and he went to live among men waiting for the crazy and the competent to join forces and come for him with their scissors orpheus listened patiently to my poem and when it quieted he said to me that wasnt it at all i sang outward from my face to blue spaces between clouds to fern fronds and men and women sipped my song as you drink from a stream going by what i sang is lost in time you dont kmow what it was all you have is your own old stories about me and if women tore me into pieces maybe that only signifies each one keeps part of my body which is melody among visible things now thou has loved me one whole day tomorrow when you leavst what wilt thou say wilt thou then antedate some new made vow or say that now we are not just those persons which we were or that oaths made in reverential fear of love and his wrath any may forswear or as true deaths true marriages untie so lovers contracts images of those bind but till sleep deaths image them unloose or your own end to justify for having purposed change and falsehood you can have no way but falsehood to be true vain lunatic against these scapes i could dispute and conquer if i would which i abstain to do for by tomorrow i may think so too i cry your mercy pity love aye love merciful love that tantalizes not one thoughted never wandering guileless love unmasked and being seen without a blot o let me have thee whole all all be mine that shape that fairness that sweet minor zest of love your kiss those hands those eyes divine that warm white lucent million pleasured breast yourself your soul in pity give me all withhold no atoms atom or i die or living on perhaps your wretched thrall forget in the mist of idle misery lifes purposes the palate of my mind losing its gust and my ambition blind you had your own reasons for getting in your own way you didnt want to be clear to yourself you knew a hell of a lot more than you were willing to let yourself know i felt natural love for you on the spot r e s p e c t right beautiful i dont use the word lightly i protested with whatever love honesty frontal nudity a yes basically reserved irish catholic american providence rhode island new englander is able to manage you are sophisticated not uncomplicated not na ve and not simple an entertainer i am too frank ohara respected love so do you so do we he was himself i was me and when we came together each ourselves in iowa all the way that was love it still is love today can you see me in what i say because as well i see you know in what you have to say i did love frank as i do you in the right way thats just talk not logos a getting down to cases i take it as simple particulars that we wear our feelings on our faces the strangers in the woods must mimic squirrels and crackle with the undergrowth they must not flinch at the cruelty of breaking golden leaves with their feet or of interring stones and like any of these deciduous trees in autumn they must be stingy with shadow and move deceptively across the sludge i listen to these strangers stirring with the evenings i invent paths for them to the soft edge of the lake each descent is as graceful as a sinking ship but less tragic somehow because these strangers dont possess a lung i cannot hear them breathe yet the air is all whispers all sighs the same ethereal muscle that rubs the color off the foliage i lost my way out of the woods on the night every bird went south or numb a plump rat snatched the moon and dragged it by the white rope of its tail the strangers were a cloak of silhouettes flattening against a trunk like bark i must have disappeared among them because the mouth i touched was not my own and was cruelly closing in on someones rib i carried such a bite on me an arc of green and yellow on my side from the man who said he loved me in that darkness i knew as much about him as i did of the amputee swimming his way up the hill with his only arm so this is the home of the unturned stone where the fugitive keeps his kiss archeologists will discover a paradise in the place no touch died of neglect is it any wonder all things forgotten or abandoned find their way here the winter is back so too the bloated body of a book i tossed over the bridge last week and there on the bench is my old smoking habit a cigarette glowing on my mouth like a beacon im patient waiting for the fugitive to claim me as his own im as wise as

why theyre cold decaying beauties why they will grow old theyll tell thee fate that every thing doth move inforces them to this and me to love there is no reason for our love or hate tis irresistible as death or fate tis not his face ive sence enough to see that is not good though doated on by me not ist his tongue that has this conquest won for that at least is equalld by my own his carriage can to none obliging be tis rude affected full of vanity strangely ill naturd peevish and unkind unconstant false to jealousie inclind his temper coud not have so great a powr tis mutable and changes every hour those vigorous years that women so adore are past in him hes twice my age and more and yet i love this false this worthless man with all the passion that a woman can doat on his imperfections though i spy nothing to love i love and know not why since tis decreed in the dark book of fate that i shoud love and he shoud be ingrate im going to murder you with love im going to suffocate you with embraces im going to hug you bone by bone till youre dead all over then i will dine on your delectable marrow you will become my personal sahara ill sun myself in you then with one swallow drain your remaining brackish well with my female blade ill carve my name in your most aspiring palm before i chop it down then ill inhale your last oasis whole but in the total desert you become youll see me stretch horizon to horizon opulent mirage wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen vistas ablaze with crystal laced in gold so you will summon each dry grain of sand and move toward me in undulating dunes till you arrive at sudden ultramarine a mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores obstinate verdure creeping inland fast renudes your barrens succulents spring up everywhere surprising life and i will be that green when you are fed and watered flourishing with shoots entwining trellis dome and spire till you are resurrected field in bloom i will devour you my natural food my host my final supper on the earth and youll begin to die again where like a pillow on a bed a pregnant bank swelld up to rest the violets reclining head sat we two one anothers best our hands were firmly cemented with a fast balm which thence did spring our eye beams twisted and did thread our eyes upon one double string so tointergraft our hands as yet was all the means to make us one and pictures in our eyes to get was all our propagation as twixt two equal armies fate suspends uncertain victory our souls which to advance their state were gone out hung twixt her and me and whilst our souls negotiate there we like sepulchral statues lay all day the same our postures were and we said nothing all the day if any so by love refind that he souls language understood and by good love were grown all mind within convenient distance stood he though he knew not which soul spake because both meant both spake the same might thence a new concoction take and part far purer than he came this ecstasy doth unperplex we said and tell us what we love we see by this it was not sex we see we saw not what did move but as all several souls contain mixture of things they know not what love these mixd souls doth mix again and makes both one each this and that a single violet transplant the strength the colour and the size all which before was poor and scant redoubles still and multiplies when love with one another so interinanimates two souls that abler soul which thence doth flow defects of loneliness controls we then who are this new soul know of what we are composd and made for th atomies of which we grow are souls whom no change can invade but oh alas so long so far our bodies why do we forbear theyare ours though theyare not we we are the intelligences they the spheres we owe them thanks because they thus did us to us at first convey yielded their senses force to us nor are dross to us but allay on man heavens influence works not so but that it first imprints the air so soul into the soul may flow though it to body first repair as our blood labors to beget spirits as like souls as it can because such fingers need to knit that subtle knot which makes us man so must pure lovers souls descend t affections and to faculties which sense may reach and apprehend else a great prince in prison lies toour bodies turn we then that so weak men on love reveald may look loves mysteries in souls do grow but yet the body is his book and if some lover such as we have heard this dialogue of one let him still mark us he shall see small change when weare to bodies gone what slender youth bedewd with liquid odors courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave pyrrha for whom bindst thou in wreaths thy golden hair plain in thy neatness o how oft shall he of faith and changed gods complain and seas rough with black winds and storms unwonted shall admire who now enjoys thee credulous all gold who always vacant always amiable hopes thee of flattering gales unmindful hapless they to whom thou untried seemst fair me in my vowd picture the sacred wall declares to have hung my dank and dropping weeds to the stern god of sea why should a foolish marriage vow which long ago was made oblige us to each other now when passion is decayd we lovd and we lovd as long as we could till our love was lovd out in us both but our marriage is dead when the pleasure is fled twas pleasure first made it an oath if i have pleasures for a friend and farther love in store what wrong has he whose joys did end and who could give no more tis a madness that he should be jealous of me or that i should bar him of another for all we can gain is to give our selves pain when neither can hinder the other at first you didnt know me i was a shape moving rapidly nervous at the edge of your vision a flat high voice dark slash of hair across my cheekbone i made myself present though never distinct things i said that he repeated a tone you could hear but never trace in his voice silence followed by talk of other things when you would sit at your desk i would creep near you like a question a thought would scurry across the front of your mind id be there ducking out of sight you must have felt me watching you my small eyes fixed on your face the smile you wondered at on the lips only the voice on the phone quick and full of business all that you saw and heard and could not find the center of those days growing into years growing inside of you out of reach now with you forever in your house in your garden in corridors of dream where i finally tell you my name if no one ever marries me and i dont see why they should for nurse says im not pretty and im seldom very good if no one ever marries me i shant mind very much i shall buy a squirrel in a cage and a little rabbit hutch i shall have a cottage near a wood and a pony all my own and a little lamb quite clean and tame that i can take to town and when im getting really old at twenty eight or nine i shall buy a little orphan girl and bring her up as mine i scissor the stem of the red carnation and set it in a bowl of water it floats the way your head would if i cut it off but what if i tore you apart for those afternoons when i was fifteen and so like a bird of paradise slaughtered for its feathers even my name suggested wings wicker cages flight come sit on my lap you said i felt as if i had flown there i was weightless you were forty and married that she was my mother never mattered she was a door that opened onto me the three of us blended into a kind of somnolence and musk the musk of sundays sweat and sweetness that dried plum and licorice taste always back of my tongue and your tongue against my teeth then touching mine how many times i counted but could never remember and when i thought wed go on forever that nothing could stop us as we fell endlessly from consciousness orders came war in the north your sword the gold epaulets the uniform so brightly colored so unlike war i thought and your horse how you rode out the gate no how that horse danced beneath you toward the sound of cannon fire i could hear it so many leagues away i could see you fall your face scarlet the horse dancing on without you and at the same moment mother sighed and turned clumsily in the hammock the madeira in the thin stemmed glass spilled into the grass and i felt myself hardening to a brandy colored wood my skin a thousand strings drawn so taut that when i walked to the house i could hear music tumbling like a waterfall of china silk behind me i took your letter from my bodice salome i heard your voice little bird fly but i did not i untied the lilac ribbon at my breasts and lay down on your bed after a while i heard mothers footsteps watched her walk to the window i closed my eyes and when i opened them the shadow of a sword passed through my throat and mother dressed like a grenadier bent and kissed me on the lips while my hair was still cut straight across my forehead i played about the front gate pulling flowers you came by on bamboo stilts playing horse you walked about my seat playing with blue plums and we went on living in the village of ch kan two small people without dislike or suspicion at fourteen i married my lord you i never laughed being bashful lowering my head i looked at the wall called to a thousand times i never looked back at fifteen i stopped scowling i desired my dust to be mingled with yours forever and forever and forever why should i climb the look out at sixteen you departed you went into far ku t en by the river of swirling eddies and you have been gone five months the monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead you dragged your feet when you went out by the gate now the moss is grown the different mosses too deep to clear them away the leaves fall early this autumn in wind the paired butterflies are already yellow with august over the grass in the west garden they hurt me i grow older if you are coming down through the narrows of the river kiang please let me know beforehand and i will come out to meet you as far as ch f sa how do i love thee let me count the ways i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace i love thee to the level of every days most quiet need by sun and candle light i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death poetry out loud note in the print anthology this poem is titled simply how do i love thee let me count the ways the student may give either title during their recitation there be none of beautys daughters with a magic like thee and like music on the waters is thy sweet voice to me when as if its sound were causing the charmed oceans pausing the waves lie still and gleaming and the lulld winds seem dreaming and the midnight moon is weaving her bright chain oer the deep whose breast is gently heaving as an infants asleep so the spirit bows before thee to listen and adore thee with a full but soft emotion like the swell of summers ocean out through the fields and the woods and over the walls i have wended i have climbed the hills of view and looked at the world and descended i have come by the highway home and lo it is ended the leaves are all dead on the ground save those that the oak is keepingto ravel them one by one and let them go scraping and creepingout over the crusted snow when others are sleeping and the dead leaves lie huddled and still no longer blown hither and thither the last lone aster is gone the flowers of the witch hazel wither the heart is still aching to seek but the feet question whither ah when to the heart of man was it ever less than a treasonto go with the drift of things to yield with a grace to reason and bow and accept the end of a love or a season escape me never beloved while i am i and you are you so long as the world contains us both me the loving and you the loth while the one eludes must the other pursue my life is a fault at last i fear it seems too much like a fate indeed though i do my best i shall scarce succeed but what if i fail of my purpose here it is but to keep the nerves at strain to dry ones eyes and laugh at a fall and baffled get up and begin again so the chase takes up ones life thats all while look but once from your farthest bound at me so deep in the dust and dark no sooner the old hope goes to ground than a new one straight to the self same mark i shape me ever removed you cant trust lesbians you invite them to your party and they dont come theyre too busy tending vaginal flowers hating football walking their golden and chocolate labs x gave me a poem in which she was in love with a woman and the church but the church couldnt accept four breasts in one bed when i asked if our coworkers knew she dropped her head and i said nothing for years until this morning i realized no one reads poems my secrets and hersare safe in verse i knew shed have enjoyed the beaujolais and i want to meet dianne mona lisa betty alice the names been changed to protect women who cant stand in a room holding hands because you cant trust heterosexuals to love love however it comes so i recorded the party for her for them the mica bit away from the action to catch the feel of waves touching shore and letting go the wash of moods across the hours of drink and yes some grapes were thrown and i breathed the quickening revelationof a cigarette someone said i gave up underwear for lent and i hope they play the tape while making love as if finally the worlds made happy by who they are laughing with not at the nipple lick clit kiss hugin bed and after the on and on of meals and moons and bills and

caught me running with lucius atherton we quarreled and i told him never again to cross my path then he stole the hogs and went to the war back of every soldier is a woman a doctor of great skill and fame paulo purganti was his name had a good comely virtuous wife no woman led a better life she to intrigue was evn hard hearted she chuckled when a bawd was carted and thought the nation neer would thrive till all the whores were burnt alive on married men that dared be bad she thought no mercy should be had they should be hanged or starved or flayed or served like romish priests in swede in short all lewdness she defied and stiff was her parochial pride yet in an honest way the dame was a great lover of that same and could from scripture take her cue that husbands should give wives their due her prudence did so justly steer between the gay and the severe that if in some regards she choseto curb poor paulo in too close in others she relaxed again and governed with a looser rein thus though she strictly did confinethe doctor from excess of wine with oysters eggs and vermicelli she let him almost burst his belly thus drying coffee was denied but chocolate that want supplied and for tobacco who could bear it filthy concomitant of claret blest resolution one might seeeringo roots and bohea tea she often stroked the doctors band and stroked his beard and kissed his hand kindly complained that after noonhe went to pore on books too soon she held it wholesomer by much to rest a little on the couch about his waist in bed a nightsshe clung on close for fear of sprites the doctor understood the call but had not always wherewithal the lions skin too short you know as plutarchs morals finely show was lengthened by the foxs tail and art supplies where strength may fail unwilling then in arms to meetthe enemy he could not beat he strove to lengthen the campaign and save his forces by chicane fabius the roman chief who thusby fair retreat grew maximus shows us that all warrior can do with force superior is cunctando one day then as the foe drew near with love and joy and life and dear our don who knew this tittle tattledid sure as trumpet call to battle thought it extremely propos to ward against the coming blow to ward but how ay theres the question fierce the assault unarmed the bastion the doctor feigned a strange surprise he felt her pulse he viewed her eyes that was too fast these rolled too quick she was he said or would be sick he judged it absolutely good that she should purge and cleanse her blood spa waters to that end were got if they passed easily or not what matters it the ladys fevercontinued as violent as ever for a distemper of this kind blackmore and hans are of my mind if once it youthful blood infects and chiefly of the female sex is scarce removed by pill or potion whateer may be our doctors notion one luckless night then as in bedthe doctor and the dame were laid again this cruel fever came high pulse short breath and blood in flame what measures shall poor paulo keep with madam in this piteous taking she like macbeth has murdered sleep and wont allow him rest though waking sad state of matters when we darenor ask for peace nor offer war nor livy nor comines have shown what in this juncture may be done grotius might own that paulos case isharder than any which he placesamongst his belli and his pacis he strove alas but strove in vain by dint of logic to maintainthat all the sex was born to grieve down to her ladyship from eve he ranged his tropes and preached up patience backed his opinion with quotations divines and moralists and run onquite through from seneca to bunyan as much in vain he bid her tryto fold her arms to close her eye telling her rest would do her good if any thing in nature could so held the greeks quite down from galen masters and princes of the calling so all our modern friends maintain though no great greeks in warwick lane reduce my muse the wandring song a tale should never be too long the more he talked the more she burned and sighed and tossed and groaned and turned at last i wish said she my dear and whispered something in his ear you wish wish on the doctor cries lord when will womankind be wise what in your waters are you mad why poison is not half so bad ill do but i give you warning youll die before tomorrow morning tis kind my dear what you advise the lady with a sign replies but life you know at best is pain and death is what we should disdain so do it therefore and adieu for i will die for love of you let wanton wives by death be scared but to my comfort im prepared madam withouten many words once i am sure ye will or no and if ye will then leave your bourds and use your wit and show it so and with a beck ye shall me call and if of one that burneth alwayye have any pity at all answer him fair with or nay if it be i shall be fain if it be nay friends as before ye shall another man obtain and i mine own and yours no more she stood breast high amid the corn clasped by the golden light of morn like the sweetheart of the sun who many a glowing kiss had won on her cheek an autumn flush deeply ripened such a blush in the midst of brown was born like red poppies grown with corn round her eyes her tresses fell which were blackest none could tell but long lashes veiled a light that had else been all too bright and her hat with shady brim made her tressy forehead dim thus she stood amid the stooks praising god with sweetest looks sure i said heaven did not mean where i reap thou shouldst but glean lay thy sheaf adown and come share my harvest and my home i students look at this table and now when you see a man six feet tall you can call him a fathom likewise students when yes and you do that and other stuff likewise too the shoe falls upon the sun and the alphabet is full of blood and when you knock upon a sentence in the process of explication you are going to need a lot of rags likewise hello and goodbye ii nick algiers is my student and he sits there in a heap in front of me thinking of suicide and so i am the one in front of him and i dance around him in a circle and light him on fire and with his face on fire i am suddenly ashamed likewise the distance between us then is the knife that is not marriage iii students i cant lie id rather be doing something else i guess like making love or writing a poem or drinking wine on a tropical island with a handsome boy who wants to hold me all night i cant lie that dreams are ridiculous and in dreaming myself upon the moon i have made the moon my home and no one can ever get to me to hit me or kiss my lips and as my bridegroom comes and takes me away from you you all ask me what is wrong and i say it is that i will never win and yesterday something shattering happened not yesterday but several thats becoming a favorite word weeks ago i came across kitajs the jewish rider and wept there he was in the very image of my stepfather the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic the same skinny legs the same misguided attempt to dress in a sporty way whos watching the same abstractedness the same shlumpy boneless posture gazing not at the landscape flashing past with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one tug the countryside would vanish or listening to the tick of the rails but fixed distractedly on his lower extremities white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon socks to see whether or not he should roll them up no looking both beyond and through physical space into an inner dark why else draw the eyes as shadows its his glimpse into another world my mothers father hunted and rode my father rode and fished my stepfather never budged from his barca lounger once the amber liquid began to pour he had a spiritual life and a social life and no physical life but he liked it that i was always outside maybe thats why he never got on my back about grades he might have thought that this boy has to be outside at this time in his life maybe its more important that he roam the canyons and the hills that he know the streets that he come home covered with leaves and bark and mud than that he sit there like a good young scholar like i was a rabbi at twenty giving money home to my parents in their cabbagy tenement in the bronx this is a boy who needs space one time i think i had my learners permit he rented a mustang convertible in l a and for several days i drove around past the long rows of used car lots and the bruised facades of restaurants digging up relatives my hoarse voiced arthritic aunt in the shadows of her goldenrod colored ranch house limping like ruffian after her last run in the wet dirt at belmont stakes but ive said nothing about what made me weep its in the contrast between kitajs alter cockerseeking comfort on a train and rembrandts taut youthsetting off into the rampant amber on horseback its in the image of active life juxtaposedwith the image of sedentary contemplation though no one travels on horseback nowand heroism has becomeattending aids patientsor sheltering the homeless the raw youths feet are plantedlightly yet firmly in his stirrups his coat glows with many colors not so the jewish rider and yet theres something more michael hoffman writes that new yorkis not what it was when i was too youngto have marked the existence of the blue note but i can pick up this trailby walking across the park to the frick and barbara hershey wouldnt have been at the frick in they dont allow children under sixteen in black skin tight pants black sweater the female uniform of our generationwhose male version substitutesblack jeans baseball hat and bomber jacket though who knows what decorous garmentsshed checked in the cloakroom and white boots with plentyof elizabethan ruff at the edges pausing to look at the polish riderwhile i scribbled notes her whiteboots stood out against the dominant darklike the jewish riders white loafers and that was good because the light in the painting is briefwhatever the time of day sunrise or sunset and the riders gaze looking out overunknown space is inward i followed his eyes through the archway toward canvaseswhere clouds roll over harborsagainst the whiteness of sailsor toward gilded robes and velvet hung rooms then back to meet wisdoms bared breastin veroneses wisdom and strength why didnt veronese have the nerveto call his painting womanwith bare breasts like tintoretto why an allegorical title when the bareflesh and bones and sinew would have done he spends his life looking notat far off hills or citadels orthe lights in the village below he has no choice but to fixon her one bared breast her swelling nipple i cant figure out what landscapehe might be facing in the painted world the clatter of rocks and hoovesechoes over the stony plain i was no rider but a pretend horse and rider always rode beside my train window at a canter no matter how fast the rails clicked by and though he wore a bandana and leaned slightly forward in the saddle to pull himself aboard his gaze wide ranging yet intent was like the polish riders even as an only child i was never lonely my mothers father rode until he was old and on a narrow pass his horse jammed him up against rockface in his narrative of his life this collision marked the ruin of his hip the rise of his cataracts my father rode every morning before work i never witnessed that but at a ranch in upper new york state while i bloodied my hands tugging the reins of a frothing giant who would not budge from a weedpatch i watched him disappear in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs as he galloped over a far off hill more at ease in the saddle in the air than id ever seen him in civilian life my woman friend in el paso lives to ride only the jewish rider and i do not ride thats the stuff of events what about the signature inscribed by the sun the dark clouds sinister in just being there thresholds exchanges going on in the village below candles lit in the deep interiors bread wine the plate making its way around the table what about leaping centuries ahead the energy from generators blazing like auras through the clouds the scattered lights the rotating tops of ambulances the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese making the rounds apple sauce passing from high chair to bib the wonder bread on a calcified plate children eating heads down in silence communicating through eye movements the mother wiping her lips the father grinning stupidly and drooling the television quacking in the background the perfect suburban night unfolding in bedroom and drive in and den the sprinkler system ticking the snipers in the tower this is what the riders guests everywhere and nowhere say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter as night comes down and last night driving to connecticut i understood that the polish rider gleans the permutations of light after dusk that its olive gray smudges reflect the absence of pitch darkness i was wrong about the polish rider all along he doesnt depart at nightfall he stops for a moment crossing difficult terrain anticipating rockslide in the night because as the faint light rimming the edges of the sky makes clear night is not absolute black but rough hewn and curious the rider lives in order to depart the woman who rode she hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house bare trees frost the whole bit i wanted our lives to be like that as rife with silences as a quaker meeting she came to me in her stride dropped her crop on the chair peeled off her britches and boots crawled under the covers her hour in the saddle had made her ready i felt like an accessory the wound was open drowsily i rolled onto her no longer caring if she was using me as the new year wore on and black ice made riding a fast track to certain death or paralysis she grew tense came to me now with clinical terms schi words i worked hard to break down the good news was she was not a true split personality the glitch that she was divorced from herself and could not love or care the light in her house was like the light before dawn on the last of my rare visits her mother jarred preserves while we watched instant replays of robert kennedy die and die her father skulked upstairs perhaps testing gadgets or wishing me off his daughter or taking precautions i would not overhear what words were ricocheting on his hot line to the patent office any objective observer standing back from the distraction of the impinging present could see that her torment overleapt any visible signs and that she was as a wasp rider the wrong person for the place she was in her resilience could not be in question she lived to stray from known paths to leap stone fences and break into open fields when her horse went down in an irish bog and she was trampled hooves branding her cheek the next day she up and mounted him again when she came to me in the dream last night her smile had loosened how lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse how well it lit up the colors of her hair i google myself i want you to love me when i feel down i want you to google me i search myself i want you to find me i google myself i want you to remind me i dont google anybody else when i think about you i google myself ooh i dont google anybody else at home alone in the middle of the night i google myself i google myself and see you before me any fool could see just how much i google myself get down on your knees friend me and poke me i dont google anybody else when i think about you i google myself ooh i dont google anybody else at home alone in the middle of the night i google myself and i like what i see oh oh oh oh i cant stop googling myself results for googling myself when i havent googled myself for a while youre the sun who makes me shine im one of millions who constantly google themselves i want to make you mine i dont google anybody else and when i think about you i google myself ooh ooh oo oo ahh hear the word of the lord ye children of pittsburgh of calistoga and tlaquepaque ye hierophants and wishbones teraphim and household plants for i am a jealous god betrayed my lover whom i uplifted has fallen to other affections weep for her outcast state for i rescind her corn and her fields her appetites and her husbands her loom and the cloth of her weaving yea as she sleeps in her bed i will crumble her idols of clay i will cause to burn in the nighther barns filled with swallows her caves of rodents and bats her racks of sidereal dresses her stacks of serpentine hats the velvet of her touch once royal i will scarify with my wrath for i am a god betrayed my lovehas reached into my weaknessand turned my heart like a fist therefore i will strip her nakedand drive her into the field in her body of filth and feathers her blood of beasts and men she ismy desolation and a forgotten name for my cosmos is contracted my first world slips from my hands tell the people my prophet hosea that i loved her more than love and she gave not love in return my anger flattens and spreadsalong the walls and windows it glances from my mirrorsand breaks the east winds bones i was a god of such strengththey could not guess my name and this woman of human warmthsuckled me like a child now i dwell with the mole blindly and my voice is thin as a gnats i grieve what grinds in me heavily i am but a half note half sung darling i leave you the forever unblooming twig half sunk in spring mud the nature that allows such delicate lasting atrocity darling darling darling my voice is a branch that would reach i leave you the ragged sky once full of cloud now not i leave you these things just as i leave you graceful passage from one something to the next darling even in this my voice dissipates into hush whiffs of light sun thrown hurtle into the ground the work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty chiefly because i cannot concentrate i have no feeling about whether what i am writing is good or bad and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me and i am sure i know the reason its that i cant stand leaving unresolved my situation with pat i hear from her fairly frequently asking when i plan to come back and she knows that i am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of january it is not mainly loneliness i feel though i feel it but i have been lonely before it is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us and that in the mean time i worry about how things are going to work out this has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before from a letter to his parents dated november rome hardly enough for me that the pail of water alive with the wrinkling light brings clearness home and

all night long by a fire fly lamp she paddles her white canoe and her fire fly lamp i soon shall see and her paddle i soon shall hear long and loving our life shall be and ill hide the maid in a cypress tree when the footstep of death is near away to the dismal swamp he speeds his path was rugged and sore through tangled juniper beds of reeds through many a fen where the serpent feeds and man never trod before and when on the earth he sunk to sleep if slumber his eyelids knew he lay where the deadly vine doth weep its venomous tear and nightly steep the flesh with blistering dew and near him the she wolf stirrd the brake and the copper snake breathd in his ear till he starting cried from his dream awake oh when shall i see the dusky lake and the white canoe of my dear he saw the lake and a meteor bright quick over its surface playd welcome he said my dear ones light and the dim shore echoed for many a night the name of the death cold maid till he hollowd a boat of the birchen bark which carried him off from shore far far he followd the meteor spark the wind was high and the clouds were dark and the boat returnd no more but oft from the indian hunters camp this lover and maid so

memoryof another place how thrilling to appear in his eyes she cant understand what hes saying shes too busy chewing his voice she looks at the mouth shell never kiss at the shoulder shell never cry on at the hand shell never hold and at the ground where their shadows meet when everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked when their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable they will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers against hills in the cooler hours before dark and the moss at the foot of the forest when green starts to leave it what they take into their privacy half of his embrace her violence at play are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them moons unearth them and when in their separate dwellings their bodies feel the next season come they no longer have anyone to whom to tell it clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness peers back in if they love it is solely to be adored it is to scatter and gather themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set in the quiet woods from the highest trees there is always something weightless falling and he who must realize that certain losses are irreparable tells himself at night before the darkest mirror that vision keeps him whole on the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves are like sheets of dark water or ice forests or husks of ships to stop a thing such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent persons thoughts the imprint they make on each others bodies is worth any pain they may have caused quiet falls around them and when she reaches for him the air greens like underwater light and the well waters drop they will see again the shadows of insects they will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed into them if what is no longer present in them cannot be restored it can at least be offered through long bewildered dusks stalks grow rains fill and pass out of clouds animals hover at the edges of fields with eyes like black pools for nothing cannot be transformed pleasure and failure feed each other daily do not think any breeze any grain of light shall be withheld all the stars will sail out for them am i to become profligate as if i were a blonde or religious as if i were french each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list but one of these days therell be nothing left with which to venture forth why should i share you why dont you get rid of someone else for a change i am the least difficult of men all i want is boundless love even trees understand me good heavens i lie under them too dont i im just like a pile of leaves however i have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures no one need never leave the confines of new york to get all the greenery one wishes i cant even enjoy a blade of grass unless i know theres a subway handy or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life it is more important to affirm the least sincere the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass do they know what theyre missing uh huh my eyes are vague blue like the sky and change all the time they are indiscriminate but fleeting entirely specific and disloyal so that no one trusts me i am always looking away or again at something after it has given me up it makes me restless and that makes me unhappy but i cannot keep them still if only i had grey green black brown yellow eyes i would stay at home and do something its not that i am curious on the contrary i am bored but its my duty to be attentive i am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth and lately so great has their anxiety become i can spare myself little sleep now there is only one man i love to kiss when he is unshaven heterosexuality you are inexorably approaching how discourage her st serapion i wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in dostoevsky how am i to become a legend my dear ive tried love but that hides you in the bosom of another and i am always springing forth from it like the lotus the ecstasy of always bursting forth but one must not be distracted by it or like a hyacinth to keep the filth of life away yes there even in the heart where the filth is pumped in and courses and slanders and pollutes and determines i will my will though i may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department that greenhouse destroy yourself if you dont know it is easy to be beautiful it is difficult to appear so i admire you beloved for the trap youve set its like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over fanny brown is run away scampered off with a cornet of horse i do love that little minx hope she may be happy tho she has vexed me by this exploit a little too poor silly cecchina or f b as we used to call her i wish she had a good whipping and pounds mrs thrale ive got to get out of here i choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans ill be back ill re emerge defeated from the valley you dont want me to go where you go so i go where you dont want me to its only afternoon theres a lot ahead there wont be any mail downstairs turning i spit in the lock and the knob turns april found on our driveway like a feather dropped by a crow of spades a playing card we played crazy eights slapping cards or holding them as if they were birds that might fly out of our hands decades ago in our childhood like the translucent whirling image i imagine prismatic and phosphorescent a murmuration of starlings swooping and iridescent but it dissolved onto a gray wall undecorated glimpses of us wearing our velvet sunday best dresses yours usually crimson mine blue we never had nice shoes now you have returned to water thanks to the neptune society spreading your ashes over the pacific april ceylon tea that amber cup from sri lanka popularly known here before americans became tea drinkers as orange pekoe our mother hated so many things tea was rattlesnake venom to her i embraced it what did you drink marilyn i saw you only with a coke or a glass of wine in your hand our mother whom you felt damaged you your life spirals the twisting iridescent birds fly at me now scintillating spinning i blink our mother drank many cups of coffee with cream a day our sad mother i blink and tell it to go back to our childhood of muddy little shoes from walking in the spider filled orange groves there the damaging must have begun she loving me so much more than you i wish there had been more stories like the one about the origin of her disliking tea at she went to celebrate being made teacher of the one room school she had attended and graduated from at her retiring teachers home she was served for the first time tea she being from a german coffee drinking family our mother hated it but politely choked it down would never again touch a drop of the poisonous beverage from that story we learned that our mother ritualized hating something expected us to admire her for it i took that negative pattern and spun it until i could have cloth enough for an eloquent garment perhaps the lesson simply made you feel yourself helpless ragged torn i never saw you that way marilyn though perhaps incomplete i pour a cup of assam take a sip let it wash through my mouth down my age damaged throat think of you sitting with me in your southern california backyard one may morning next to the camellia bush i as always with a cup of tea in my hand you smoking i left all my family you were part of it left california and reinvented myself even mythologized myself as a tan california girl you did not become an artist or a poet i suppose thats why you felt damaged if only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice it took for me to get away so many small things can save us from the damage you talked of for me drinking that first cup of orange pekoe and making tea my drink risking rattlesnake poison with every steaming cup a tiny emblem of a rebellion i still try to practice you left us so quickly marilyn and without any warning this january your house full of cancelled aspirations glass bowls and cylinders and huge globes filled with sea scallop shells you combed the california seashores to find collecting these empty shells washed free of their biological life out of the ocean we two different daughters of a sailor april the spinning the scissors the measuring and thus our lives are given out from the heavens with unfair allotments and varied unaccountable fates born when we are and to whom you would have prevailed in an age where women had to spin weave the material cut it into britches and dresses undergarments and sheets sew and keep clean warm and comfortable a household full or a castle full men children hired hands maidservants you would have done it so well but you would have died young in such a world diabetes asthma chronic bronchial infections even in the st century where you lived to be a world where all your skills were plied as substitute for being an artist when i asked you a year ago not knowing that you would die this january what you would most like to have if money were not the object since clearly all your measuring cutting and sewing had been for economical reasons not art you thought for a bit raising your chin a swimming pool in my backyard one i could step into every morning swim float maybe in the afternoon id go for a dip many evenings i think she said to me longing for some ocean in our portrait if someone paints it she will be sitting in a scallop shell her many jars of seashells behind her head i will be invisible except for the spinning murmuration of birds that radiates past me they read at her funeral a poem from her journal about lying on the beach the sand embracing her how much she loved it felt safe felt released oh marilyn all those seashells emptied of their living fleshy occupants the ugly parts that die and rot now glorious empty rooms in which to live an imaginary life to decorate to create beauty spaces to live a different life what is left but your desires locked in glass and an image of you walking your beloved beaches hands full of seashells your footprints measured then quickly filled with the tidal flow april my spinning a whirlpool of faceted moving lights everything is numbers down into a vortical glare that replaces my own minds desire everything is numbers everything is numbers floating down like the crows onyx feather the of spades random card appearing last week over gravel legs on a spider the arachnid so many people seem to fear yet i lose track of time stare into the wall or any space to replace real images with my imaginary ones some random spider who spins my fate crazy eights the child card game marilyn and i played pieces of eight the dollar of pirate spain our childhood in orange county a vertical infinity sign everything is numbers your fire opal that daddy brought to you from india and our mother paid a jeweler to set it into a ring you wore the ring more than sixty years i suppose it was on your finger at death spinning spinning to scintillate and iridesce we never had nice shoes april easter sunday you and i always dyed easter eggs together our mother busy at her forty hour a week bookkeepers job i was intrigued with the colors but they never turned out so bright when coloring the eggs you the artist were interested in the designs to transfer onto the eggs cartoons bunnies chicks we kept our eggs separated from each other put them in separate bowls neither caring for the others creation still we felt connected even joyful on those few holiday projects not enough to make us friends my unwillingness to be like our classmates embarrassed you you chose invisibility in school rather than being known as dianes sister that unwillingness to be like others was what made me a poet so many little things but that early decision of yours not to understand why i wanted to be weird is what made you make so many other small choices preventing you from becoming an artist look away our mother said to us when there were ugly things confronting us i could not do that you blame our mother yet it was you who decided to look away even though it meant not seeing the whole world even if meant you didnt become an artist poverty of course was the reason we never had nice shoes april all numbers have disappeared instead there are mushrooms fungi that has always seemed more artful than tasty sipping a cup of tea soothes me as the mushrooms in a veloute sauce never could i feel stymied a rider with no horse i want only to watch the stories unfold the secret stories about why you chose to marry and have children why i did not the stories i try to banish blot out replace with the diamond dog a murmuration of iridescent starlings and the spider of eight twirling on its silk line projecting infinity art is made when you subject yourself to the unacceptable then dredge yourself out find a mineral replacement infinity iridescer irised feather scintillater a crystalline body whirls releasing me from the history the stories its so hard to tell until recent years my sister and i either ignored or disliked each other we fought continuously as children i have in my wrist a black bump that protrudes near a vein its the point of a pencil that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled for the long yellow weapon a pencil the weapon of a writer but there was no bleeding no seeming wound to be dressed we never told our mother both too ashamed of our brutality ive never asked a doctor about it the pencil lead encapsulated in my wrist nor ever spoken of it to anyone i always wonder that so much must remain a secret why we never had nice shoes april young marilyn old marilyn there are places on this planet where i find it hard to detect any beauty therefore silence no nice shoes april there is silence april drinking a blend of traditional darjeeling with a touch of ceylon this tea takes me back to a viennese visit drinking this very tea in the afternoon while my friend jonathan ate their famous sacher torte the tea seemed particularly aromatic lightly scented with oil of bergamot and a hint of genuine bourbon vanilla wishing for the moment in the past to reappear i didnt know the tea from the sacher hotel was as famous as the cake until i found in my upton tea catalogue a listing for scented darjeeling under the heading earl grey blends this tea any cup of tea hard to believe no sad to think my mother almost spat out her first taste of tea what worldly thing must i touch to bring marilyn back into my sedate life my sister marilyn who died in january her hand id like to imagine timidly touching her hand marilyns hand her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring in that hand shed be holding a cigarette smoke and fire makes me think of her not water though it was that pacific ocean filled with seashells that she was in touch with my old hands not really like hers at all she had big hands for shaping things while mine are small like birds turtles generate poemsno wonder they move so slowly somebody in there istrying to write pictures of bugs bunny dressed like a thugwhat drove me to draw this pictureof bugs bunny dressed like a thug plural pictures not once did i sketchthe buff tattooed torso of thug bugsbut many times over several days he looks mean doesnt he when o whenwill this election be overso i can blow off life againwithout inadvertently producing objectsof great and mysterious to me beauty poem for a sixth weddingyou know a lot better than i dowhat youre doing i like to touch your tattoos in complete darkness when i cant see them im sure of where they are know by heart the neat lines of lightning pulsing just above your nipple can find as if by instinct the blue swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent twists facing a dragon when i pull you to me taking you until were spent and quiet on the sheets i love to kiss the pictures in your skin theyll last until youre seared to ashes whatever persists or turns to pain between us they will still be there such permanence is terrifying so i touch them in the dark but touch them trying in a dark time the eye begins to see i meet my shadow in the deepening shade i hear my echo in the echoing wood a lord of nature weeping to a tree i live between the heron and the wren beasts of the hill and serpents of the den whats madness but nobility of soul at odds with circumstance the days on fire i know the purity of pure despair my shadow pinned against a sweating wall that place among the rocks is it a cave or winding path the edge is what i have a steady storm of correspondences a night flowing with birds a ragged moon and in broad day the midnight come again a man goes far to find out what he is death of the self in a long tearless night all natural shapes blazing unnatural light dark dark my light and darker my desire my soul like some heat maddened summer fly keeps buzzing at the sill which i is i a fallen man i climb out of my fear the mind enters itself and god the mind and one is one free in the tearing wind before anything could happen flecks of real gold on her mouth her eyes more convex than any others the ground spoke the barrier of lilacs spoke what sang in the black tree was entirely gold her chair was empty new absence is a great figure dark as the underskin of fruit at the center of the earth it surrounds and amplifies the dead whose music never slows down she came by car i came by train we embraced it was at the foot of a hill steeply crowned with apples and a ruined fortress imagination did not make the world sweetness is the entire portion before anything could happen happiness the necessary precondition of the world spoke and flowered over the hill when i was in hell on the ruined palisade either mystery or loneliness kissed my open eyes it felt hugely convex seeing and immediately forgetting by contrast what i imagined later was nothing delirium after rimbaudhow many hours i keptthat vigil by your side entire nights eyes wide as you so sweetly slept what i was wondering why you yearned to evadethe real no one has prayedharder for anything it wasnt for your lifei feared but for mankind did you in the end findsecrets for changing life defaced after rilkethe head we cannot know nor its bright fruit the eyes and yet the body hasits gaze a lamp turned low or else the breast would ceaseto dazzle the hips failto curve into that smilethat begets more than a kiss and flesh would lose all life not flare till theres no blindit cant see you behind you must change your life denial after seferisthe afternoon grew hotteralong our secret shore we thirsted in the glarebut couldnt drink the water on golden sand we tracedyour name beside the sea the wind came like a sigh our writing was erased how passionate our life how full of sex and song spirit and heart how wrong and so we changed our life sweetheart for such a day one mustnt grudge the score here then its all to pay its good night at the door good night and good dreams to you do you remember the picture book thieves who left two children sleeping in a wood the long night through and how the birds came down and covered them with leaves so you and i should have slept but now oh what a lonely head with just the shadow of a waving bough in the moonlight over your bed i i can hear little clicks inside my dream night drips its silver tap down the back at a m i wake thinking of the man who left in september his name was law my face in the bathroom mirror has white streaks down it i rinse the face and return to bed tomorrow i am going to visit my mother she she lives on a moor in the north she lives alone spring opens like a blade there i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books some for my mother some for me including the collected works of emily bront this is my favourite author also my main fear which i mean to confront whenever i visit my mother i feel i am turning into emily bront my lonely life around me like a moor my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation that dies when i come in the kitchen door what meat is it emily we need three three silent women at the kitchen table my mothers kitchen is dark and small but out the window there is the moor paralyzed with ice it extends as far as the eye can see over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps once a minute over the twelve i have emily p propped open on the sugarbowl but am covertly watching my mother a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside my mother is studying her lettuce i turn to p in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass now and then a remark trails through the glass taxes on the back lot not a good melon too early for melons hairdresser in town found god closes shop every tuesday mice in the teatowel drawer again little pellets chew off the corners of the napkins if they knew what paper napkins cost nowadays rain tonight rain tomorrow that volcano in the philippines at it again whats her name anderson died no not shirley the opera singer negress cancer not eating your garnish you dont like pimento out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth at the middle of the moor where the ground goes down into a depression the ice has begun to unclench black open water comes curdling up like anger my mother speaks suddenly that psychotherapys not doing you much good is it you arent getting over him my mother has a way of summing things up she never liked law much but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life well hes a taker and youre a giver i hope it works out was all she said after she met him give and take were just words to me at the time i had not been in love before it was like a wheel rolling downhill but early this morning while mother slept and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing come in come in to the ghost of his hearts darling i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too she knows how to hang puppies that emily it isnt like taking an aspirin you know i answer feebly dr haw says grief is a long process she frowns what does it accomplish all that raking up the past oh i spread my hands i prevail i look her in the eye she grins yes you do whacher whacher emilys habitual spelling of this word has caused confusion for example in the first line of the poem printed tell me whether is it winter in the shakespeare head edition but whacher is what she wrote whacher is what she was she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night she whached eyes stars inside outside actual weather she whached the bars of time which broke she whached the poor core of the world wide open to be a whacher is not a choice there is nowhere to get away from it no ledge to climb up to like a swimmer who walks out of the water at sunset shaking the drops off it just flies open to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy although she uses these words in her verse as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel grazing with euphemism the work of whaching but it has no name it is transparent sometimes she calls it thou emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet records charlotte in unsociable even at home and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out emily made her awkward way across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers this sad stunted life says one uninteresting unremarkable wracked by disappointment and despair says another she could have been a great navigator if shed been male suggests a third meanwhile emily continued to brush into the carpet the question why cast the world away for someone hooked up to thou the world may have seemed a kind of half finished sentence but in between the neighbour who recalls her coming in from a walk on the moors with her face lit up by a divine light and the sister who tells us emily never made a friend in her life is a space where the little raw soul slips through it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel out of sight the little raw soul was caught by no one she didnt have friends children sex religion marriage success a salary or a fear of death she worked in total six months of her life at a school in halifax and died on the sofa at home at p m on a winter afternoon in her thirty first year she spent most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet walking the moor or whaching she says it gave her peace all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this day years she wrote in her diary paper of yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons vaults cages bars curbs bits bolts fetters locked windows narrow frames aching walls why all the fuss asks one critic she wanted liberty well didnt she have it a reasonably satisfactory homelife a most satisfactory dreamlife why all this beating of wings what was this cage invisible to us which she felt herself to be confined in well there are many ways of being held prisoner i am thinking as i stride over the moor as a rule after lunch mother has a nap and i go out to walk the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april carve into me with knives of light something inside it reminds me of childhood it is the light of the stalled time after lunch when clocks tick and hearts shut and fathers leave to go back to work and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering something they never tell you remember too much my mother said to me recently why hold onto all that and i said where can i put it down she shifted to a question about airports crops of ice are changing to mud all around me as i push on across the moor warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun on the edge of the moor our pines dip and coast in breezes from somewhere else perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is to watch the year repeat its days it is as if i could dip my hand down into time and scoop up blue and green lozenges of april heat a year ago in another country i can feel that other day running underneath this one like an old videotape here we go fast around the last corner up the hill to his house shadows of limes and roses blowing in the car window and music spraying from the radio and him singing and touching my left hand to his lips law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now still carries the sound of the telephone in that room and traffic far off and doves under the window chuckling coolly and his voice saying you beauty i can feel that beautys heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room no i say aloud i force my arms down through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water and the videotape jerks to a halt like a glass slide under a drop of blood i stop and turn and stand into the wind which now plunges towards me over the moor when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die this is not uncommon i took up the practice of meditation each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa and chanted bits of old latin prayers de profundis clamavi ad te domine each morning a vision came to me gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul i called them nudes nude woman alone on a hill she stands into the wind it is a hard wind slanting from the north long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the womans body and lift and blow away on the wind leaving an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle calling mutely through lipless mouth it pains me to record this i am not a melodramatic person but soul is hewn in a wild workshop as charlotte bront says of wuthering heights charlottes preface to wuthering heights is a publicists masterpiece like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte talks firmly and calmly about the other furniture of emilys workshop about the inexorable spirit stronger than a man simpler than a child the cruel illness pain no words can render the autonomous end she sank rapidly she made haste to leave us and about emilys total subjection to a creative project she could neither understand nor control and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame than if she had opened her mouth to breathe lightning the scorpion is inching down the arm of the sofa while charlotte continues to speak helpfully about lightning and other weather we may expect to experience when we enter emilys electrical atmosphere it is a horror of great darkness that awaits us there but emily is not responsible emily was in the grip having formed these beings she did not know what she had done says charlotte of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine well there are many ways of being held prisoner the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee as charlotte concludes on herself she had no pity pitiless too are the heights which emily called wuthering because of their bracing ventilation and a north wind over the edge whaching a north wind grind the moor that surrounded her fathers house on every side formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities an angry education that shapes the way her characters use one another my love for heathcliff says catherine resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary necessary i notice the sun has dimmed and the afternoon air sharpening i turn and start to recross the moor towards home what are the imperatives that hold people like catherine and heathcliff together and apart like pores blown into hot rock and then stranded out of reach of one another when it hardens what kind of necessity is that the last time i saw law was a black night in september autumn had begun my knees were cold inside my clothes a chill fragment of moon rose he stood in my living room and spoke without looking at me not enough spin on it he said of our five years of love inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces which floated apart by now i was so cold it was like burning i put out my hand to touch his he moved back i dont want to be sexual with you he said everything gets crazy but now he was looking at me yes i said as i began to remove my clothes everything gets crazy when nude i turned my back because he likes the back he moved onto me everything i know about love and its necessities i learned in that one moment when i found myself thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon at a man who no longer cherished me there was no area of my mind not appalled by this action no part of my body that could have done otherwise but to talk of mind and body begs the question soul is the place stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind where such necessity grinds itself out soul is what i kept watch on all that night law stayed with me we lay on top of the covers as if it werent really a night of sleep and time caressing and singing to one another in our made up language like the children we used to be that was a night that centred heaven and hell as emily would say we tried to fuck but he remained limp although happy i came again and again each time accumulating lucidity until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down on the two souls clasped there on the bed with their mortal boundaries visible around them like lines on a map i saw the lines harden he left in the morning it is very cold walking into the long scraped april wind at this time of year there is no sunset just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away kitchen kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in no sound from the rest of the house i wait a moment then open the fridge brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed after extracting the yogurt container from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles i close the fridge door bluish dusk fills the room like a sea slid back i lean against the sink white foods taste best to me and i prefer to eat alone i dont know why once i heard girls singing a may day song that went violante in the pantry gnawing at a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she felt herself alone girls are cruelest to themselves someone like emily bront who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow we can see her ridding herself of it at various times with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet reason with him and then whip him was her instruction age six to her father regarding brother branwell and when she was and bitten by a rabid dog she strode they say into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied them directly to her arm cauterization of heathcliff took longer more than thirty years in the time of the novel from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen and vanishes over the moor because he overheard half a sentence of catherines it would degrade me to marry heathcliff until the wild morning when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights heathcliff is a pain devil if he had stayed in the kitchen long enough to hear the other half of catherines sentence so he will never know how i love him heathcliff would have been set free but emily knew how to catch a devil she put into him in place of a soul the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system every time he drew a breath or moved thought she broke all his moments in half with the kitchen door standing open i am not unfamiliar with this half life but there is more to it than that heathcliffs sexual despair arose out of no such experience in the life of emily bront so far as we know her question which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain devil came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen kichin in emilys spelling where she and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet there is a fragment of a poem she wrote in about six years before wuthering heights that says that iron man was born like me and he was once an ardent boy he must have felt in infancy the glory of a summer sky who is the iron man my mothers voice cuts across me from the next room where she is lying on the sofa is that you dear yes ma why dont you turn on a light in there out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun jab its last cold yellow streaks across a dirty silver sky okay ma whats for supper liberty liberty means different things to different people i have never liked lying in bed in the morning law did my mother does but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it moving along the moor into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs and i am free out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky frozen mud crunches underfoot the sound startles me back into the dream i was having this morning when i awoke one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in laws arms like a needle in water it is a physical effort to pull myself out of his white silk hands as they slide down my dream hips i turn and face into the wind and begin to run goblins devils and death stream behind me in the days and months after law left i felt as if the sky was torn off my life i had no home in goodness anymore to see the love between law and me turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another towards some other hunger was terrible perhaps this is what people mean by original sin i thought but what love could be prior to it what is prior what is love my questions were not original nor did i answer them mornings when i meditated i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul not the complex mysteries of love and hate but the nudes are still as clear in my mind as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight there were in all thirteen of them nude woman caught in a cage of thorns big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them where she twists this way and that way unable to stand upright nude woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead she grips it in both hands endeavouring to wrench it out nude woman on a blasted landscape backlit in red like hieronymus bosch covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption like the top half of a crab with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater she works hard at dislodging the crab it was about this time i began telling dr haw about the nudes she said when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them why keep watching why not go away i was amazed go away where i said this still seems to me a good question but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light is filling the moor with gold milk i have reached the middle where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water it is frozen a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it and sway in the blue air each trunk where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures thousands of hair thin cracks catching the white of the light like a jailed face catching grins through the bars emily bront has a poem about a woman in jail who says a messenger of hope comes every night to me and offers for short life eternal liberty i wonder what kind of liberty this is her critics and commentators say she means death or a visionary experience that prefigures death they understand her prison as the limitations placed on a clergymans daughter by nineteenth century life in a remote parish on a cold moor in the north of england they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life in so much of bront s work the self dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama says one another refers to the cardboard sublime of her caught world i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes when i realized i had no way to answer her question why keep watching some people watch thats all i can say there is nowhere else to go no ledge to climb up to perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment as with a very difficult sister on that mind time and experience alone could work to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable wrote charlotte of emily i wonder what kind of conversation these two had over breakfast at the parsonage my sister emily was not a person of demonstrative character charlotte emphasizes nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could with impunity intrude unlicensed recesses were many one autumn day in charlotte accidentally lighted on a ms volume of verse in my sister emilys handwriting it was a small x notebook with a dark red cover marked d and contained poems in emilys minute hand charlotte had known emily wrote verse but felt more than surprise at its quality not at all like the poetry women generally write further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emilys novel not least for its foul language she gently probes this recess in her editors preface to wuthering heights a large class of readers likewise will suffer greatly from the introduction into the pages of this work of words printed with all their letters which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter only a blank line filling the interval well there are different definitions of liberty love is freedom law was fond of saying i took this to be more a wish than a thought and changed the subject but blank lines do not say nothing as charlotte puts it the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse strikes me as a proceeding which however well meant is weak and futile i cannot tell what good it does what feeling it spares what horror it conceals i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor towards home and breakfast it is a two way traffic the language of the unsaid my favourite pages of the collected works of emily bront are the notes at the back recording small adjustments made by charlotte to the text of emilys verse which charlotte edited for publication after emilys death prison for strongest in emilys hand altered to lordly by charlotte hero i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast whether she had a good night and is about to say a happy thing or not not she puts her toast down on the side of her plate you know you can pull the drapes in that room she begins this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments from what i call the rules of life series my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night i open mine as wide as possible i like to see everything i say whats there to see moon air sunrise all that light on your face in the morning wakes you up i like to wake up at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta and may advance along one of three channels there is the what you need is a good nights sleep channel the stubborn as your father channel and random channel more toast i interpose strongly pushing back my chair those women says my mother with an exasperated rasp mother has chosen random channel women complaining about rape all the time i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterdays newspaper lying beside the grape jam the front page has a small feature about a rally for international womens day have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue nope why its a disgrace those bathing suits cut way up to here she points no wonder youre saying women deserve to get raped because sears bathing suit ads have high cut legs ma are you serious well someone has to be responsible why should women be responsible for male desire my voice is high oh i see youre one of them one of whom my voice is very high mother vaults it and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green one it looked so smart on you the frail fact drops on me from a great height that my mother is afraid she will be eighty years old this summer her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe make me think of emily bront s little merlin hawk hero that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn t around so ma well go i pop up the toaster and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate visit dad today she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility leave at eleven home again by four i continue she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes silence is assent in our code i go into the next room to phone the taxi my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care about miles from here he suffers from a kind of dementia characterized by two sorts of pathological change first recorded in by alois alzheimer first the presence in cerebral tissue of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells second neurofibrillary snarlings in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus there is no known cause or cure mother visits him by taxi once a week for the last five years marriage is for better or for worse she says this is the worse so about an hour later we are in the taxi shooting along empty country roads towards town the april light is clear as an alarm as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object existing in space on its own shadow i wish i could carry this clarity with me into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy these are my two wishes it is hard to find the beginning of dementia i remember a night about ten years ago when i was talking to him on the telephone it was a sunday night in winter i heard his sentences filling up with fear he would start a sentence about weather lose his way start another it made me furious to hear him floundering my tall proud father former world war ii navigator it made me merciless i stood on the edge of the conversation watching him thrash about for cues offering none and it came to me like a slow avalanche that he had no idea who he was talking to much colder today i guess his voice pressed into the silence and broke off snow falling on it there was a long pause while snow covered us both well i wont keep you he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land ill say goodnight now i wont run up your bill goodbye goodbye goodbye who are you i said into the dial tone at the hospital we pass down long pink halls through a door with a big window and a combination lock to the west wing for chronic care patients each wing has a name the chronic wing is our golden mile although mother prefers to call it the last lap father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles my father tilts least i am proud of him hi dad how ydoing his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air my mother lays her hand on his hello love she says he jerks his hand away we sit sunlight flocks through the room mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him grapes arrowroot biscuits humbugs he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us he uses a language known only to himself made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash you dont say or happy birthday to you but no real sentence for more than three years now i notice his front teeth are getting black i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people he always took good care of his teeth my mother looks up she and i often think two halves of one thought do you remember that gold plated toothpick you sent him from harrods the summer you were in london she asks yes i wonder what happened to it must be in the bathroom somewhere she is giving him grapes one by one they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers he used to be a big man over six feet tall and strong but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house except the hands the hands keep growing each one now as big as a boot in van gogh they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables that break off on a high note he waits staring into my face that quizzical look one eyebrow at an angle i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane hands firmly behind backs legs wide apart chins forward dressed in the puffed flying suits with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch they squint into the brilliant winter sun of it is dawn they are leaving dover for france my father on the far left is the tallest airman with his collar up one eyebrow at an angle the shadowless light makes him look immortal for all the world like someone who will not weep again he is still staring into my face flaps down i cry his black grin flares once and goes out like a match hot hot blue moonlight down the steep sky i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies with my eyes pouring into the dark fumbling and slowly consciousness replaces the bars dreamtails and angry liquids swim back down to the middle of me i t is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now this is not uncommon after loss of love blue and black and red blasting the crater open i am interested in anger i clamber along to find the source my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires each wire has a little black switch one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on she keeps switching and switching in rising tides of very hot anger then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices at the rooms of the rest of the house the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch small creatures not quite cats not quite rats licking their narrow red jaws under a load of time i want to be beautiful again she whispers but the great overlit rooms tick emptily as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark a rustling sound comes my pajamas are soaked anger travels through me pushes aside everything else in my heart pouring up the vents every night i wake to this anger the soaked bed the hot pain box slamming me each way i move i want justice slam i want an explanation slam i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever slam i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp night springs out the window and is gone over the moor i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears and thinking about curses emily bront was good at cursing falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in her verse well thou halt paid me back my love but if there be a god above whose arm is strong whose word is true this hell shall wring thy spirit too the curses are elaborate there go deceiver go my hand is streaming wet my hearts blood flows to buy the blessing to forget oh could that lost heart give back back again to thine one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline but they do not bring her peace vain words vain frenzied thoughts no ear can hear me call lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still life bows to my control but love i cannot kill her anger is a puzzle it raises many questions in me to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt by someone who rarely left home except to go to church or take a walk on the hills charlotte tells us and who had no more intercourse with haworth folk than a nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates how did emily come to lose faith in humans she admired their dialects studied their genealogies but with them she rarely exchanged a word her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor what did emily know of lovers lies or cursive human faith among her biographers is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child during her six month stay in halifax but there is no evidence at all for such an event and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her years banal sexism aside i find myself tempted to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge for all that life withheld from emily but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women it is a chilly thought the heart is dead since infancy unwept for let the body go suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin the vocation of anger is not mine i know my source it is stunning it is a moment like no other when ones lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore i switch off the lamp and lie on my back thinking about emilys cold young soul where does unbelief begin when i was young there were degrees of certainty i could say yes i know that i have two hands then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally disappear from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle back down under the doorsill of sleep out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks of sky our guests are darkly lodged i whispered gazing through the vault thou the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness and i prefer to put it off it is morning astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east i am walking into the light one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou she describes thou as awake like herself all night and full of strange power thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind thou and emily influence one another in the darkness playing near and far at once she talks about a sweetness that proved us one i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet there is no question it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night without the terrible sex price to pay this is a childish idea i know my education i have to admit has been gappy the basic rules of male female relations were imparted atmospherically in our family no direct speech allowed i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car father in front we were waiting in the driveway for mother who came around the corner of the house and got into the passenger side of the car dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels father glanced sideways at her showing a good bit of leg today mother he said in a voice which i age eleven thought odd i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say her answer would clear this up but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh i overheard as i was going upstairs she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek most of the time but you know men she was saying laugh not ropes thorns i have arrived at the middle of the moor where the ground goes down into a low swampy place the swamp water is frozen solid bits of gold weed have etched themselves on the underside of the ice like messages ill come when thou art saddest laid alone in the darkened room when the mad days mirth has vanished and the smile of joy is banished ill come when the hearts real feeling has entire unbiased sway and my influence oer thee stealing grief deepening joy congealing shall bear thy soul away listen tis just the hour the awful time for thee dost thou not feel upon thy soul a flood of strange sensations roll forerunners of a sterner power heralds of me very hard to read the messages that pass between thou and emily in this poem she reverses their roles speaking not as the victim but to the victim it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered it is a shock to realize that this low slow collusion of master and victim within one voice is a rationale for the most awful loneliness of the poets hour she has reversed the roles of thou and thou not as a display of power but to force out of herself some pity for this soul trapped in glass which is her true creation those nights lying alone are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn it is who i am is it a vocation of anger why construe silence as the real presence why stoop to kiss this doorstep why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul emily was fond of psalm my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire in thou they arc quenched as a fire of thorns says the psalmist but for myself i do not believe this i am not quenched with thou or without thou i find no shelter i am my own nude and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny i have watched this destiny disclose itself in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now from love to anger to this cold marrow from fire to shelter to fire what is the opposite of believing in thou merely not believing in thou no that is too simple that is to prepare a misunderstanding i want to speak more clearly perhaps the nudes are the best way nude deck of cards each card is made of flesh the living cards are days of a womans life i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to end nude i cannot remember nude white room whose walls having neither planes nor curves nor angles are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon it is a living surface almost wet lucency breathes in and out rainbows shudder across it and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering be very careful be very careful nude black disc on which the fires of all the winds are attached in a row a woman stands on the disc amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames flow and vibrate up through her nude transparent loam under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench into the trench she is placing small white forms i dont know what they are nude green thorn of the world poking up alive through the heart of a woman who lies on her back on the ground the thorn is exploding its green blood above her in the air everything it is it has the voice says nude ledge in outer space space is bluish black and glossy as solid water and moving very fast in all directions shrieking past the woman who stands pinned to nothing by its pressure she peers and glances for some way to go trying to lift her hand but cannot nude old pole in the wind cold currents are streaming over it and pulling out into ragged long horizontal black lines some shreds of ribbon attached to the pole i cannot see how they are attached notches staples nails all of a sudden the wind changes and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air and tie themselves into knots then untie and float down the wind is gone it waits by this time midway through winter i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama then it stopped days passed months passed and i saw nothing i continued to peer and glance sitting on the rug in front of my sofa in the curtainless morning with my nerves open to the air like something skinned i saw nothing outside the window spring storms came and went april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off and fall and i thought how slow as it glided soundlessly past but still nothing no nudes no thou a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle hoping to trick myself into some interior vision but all i saw was the man and woman in the room across the street making their bed and laughing i stopped watching i forgot about nudes i lived my life which felt like a switched off tv something had gone through me and out and i could not own it no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind emily does not feel them wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister emily had shaken free a soul can do that whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings you and i will never know but i can tell you what i saw nude arrived when i was not watching for it it came at night very much like nude and yet utterly different i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached but as i came closer i saw it was a human body trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones and there was no pain the wind was cleansing the bones they stood forth silver and necessary it was not my body not a womans body it was the body of us all it walked out of the light for i have loved the blade with all my crippled with all my awkward soul loved it for the shine sheen for the ease and grace of doing what it was made to do for i have loved the stubborn womb its beloved intent have loved the hope and then learned to love the lack for i have loved the water the way it comes to me comes for me in all its liquid mystery for i have loved what the water loves its myriad vessels sky basin runnel channel and vein for all it claims and contains for i have loved its muscular flex its rise coil and fall so like leviathans mighty desperate heart for i have loved leviathan for being only for being exactly what god hated and what he made for being waters own knife this wild unholy blade its too cold to smoke outside but if you come over ill keep my hands to myself or wont i i would like to tell you about the wall eaten up by the climbing plant it was so beautiful various things have been happening to me all of them

why alas and are you he be not yet those fancies changed dear when you find change in me though from me you be estranged let my change to ruin be well in absence this will die leave to see and leave to wonder absence sure will help if i can learn how myself to sunder from what in my heart doth lie but time will these thoughts remove time doth work what no man knoweth time doth as the subject prove with time still the affection groweth in the faithful turtle dove what if you new beauties see will not they stir new affection i will think they pictures be image like of saints perfection poorly counterfeiting thee but your reasons purest light bids you leave such minds to nourish dear do reason no such spite never doth thy beauty flourish more than in my reasons sight but the wrongs love bears will make love at length leave undertaking no the more fools it do shake in a ground of so firm making deeper still they drive the stake peace i think that some give ear come no more lest i get anger bliss i will my bliss forbear fearing sweet you to endanger but my soul shall harbour there well begone begone i say lest that argus eyes perceive you oh unjust fortunes sway which can make me thus to leave you and from louts to run away i celebrate myself and sing myself and what i assume you shall assume for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you i loafe and invite my soul i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass my tongue every atom of my blood formd from this soil this air born here of parents born here from parents the same and their parents the same i now thirty seven years old in perfect health begin hoping to cease not till death creeds and schools in abeyance retiring back a while sufficed at what they are but never forgotten i harbor for good or bad i permit to speak at every hazard nature without check with original energy houses and rooms are full of perfumes the shelves are crowded with perfumes i breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it the distillation would intoxicate me also but i shall not let it the atmosphere is not a perfume it has no taste of the distillation it is odorless it is for my mouth forever i am in love with it i will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked i am mad for it to be in contact with me the smoke of my own breath echoes ripples buzzd whispers love root silk thread crotch and vine my respiration and inspiration the beating of my heart the passing of blood and air through my lungs the sniff of green leaves and dry leaves and of the shore and dark colord sea rocks and of hay in the barn the sound of the belchd words of my voice loosd to the eddies of the wind a few light kisses a few embraces a reaching around of arms the play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag the delight alone or in the rush of the streets or along the fields and hill sides the feeling of health the full noon trill the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun have you reckond a thousand acres much have you reckond the earth much have you practisd so long to learn to read have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems you shall possess the good of the earth and sun there are millions of suns left you shall no longer take things at second or third hand nor look through the eyes of the dead nor feed on the spectres in books you shall not look through my eyes either nor take things from me you shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self i have heard what the talkers were talking the talk of the beginning and the end but i do not talk of the beginning or the end there was never any more inception than there is now nor any more youth or age than there is now and will never be any more perfection than there is now nor any more heaven or hell than there is now urge and urge and urge always the procreant urge of the world out of the dimness opposite equals advance always substance and increase always sex always a knit of identity always distinction always a breed of life to elaborate is no avail learnd and unlearnd feel that it is so sure as the most certain sure plumb in the uprights well entretied braced in the beams stout as a horse affectionate haughty electrical i and this mystery here we stand clear and sweet is my soul and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul lack one lacks both and the unseen is proved by the seen till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things while they discuss i am silent and go bathe and admire myself welcome is every organ and attribute of me and of any man hearty and clean not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile and none shall be less familiar than the rest i am satisfied i see dance laugh sing as the hugging and loving bed fellow sleeps at my side through the night and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread leaving me baskets coverd with white towels swelling the house with their plenty shall i postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes that they turn from gazing after and down the road and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two and which is ahead trippers and askers surround me people i meet the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city i live in or the nation the latest dates discoveries inventions societies authors old and new my dinner dress associates looks compliments dues the real or fancied indifference of some man or woman i love the sickness of one of my folks or of myself or ill doing or loss or lack of money or depressions or exaltations battles the horrors of fratricidal war the fever of doubtful news the fitful events these come to me days and nights and go from me again but they are not the me myself apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am stands amused complacent compassionating idle unitary looks down is erect or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest looking with side curved

or arguments i witness and wait i believe in you my soul the other i am must not abase itself to you and you must not be abased to the other loafe with me on the grass loose the stop from your throat not words not music or rhyme i want not custom or lecture not even the best only the lull i like the hum of your valv d voice i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning how you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turnd over upon me and parted the shirt from my bosom bone and plunged your tongue to my bare stript heart and reachd till you felt my beard and reachd till you held my feet swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own and that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women my sisters and lovers and that a kelson of the creation is love and limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields and brown ants in the little wells beneath them and mossy scabs of the worm fence heapd stones elder mullein and poke weed a child said what is the grass fetching it to me with full hands how could i answer the child i do not know what it is any more than he i guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green stuff woven or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt bearing the owners name someway in the corners that we may see and remark and say whose or i guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the vegetation or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic and it means sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones growing among black folks as among white kanuck tuckahoe congressman cuff i give them the same i receive them the same and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves tenderly will i use you curling grass it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men it may be if i had known them i would have loved them it may be you are from old people or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers laps and here you are the mothers laps this grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers darker than the colorless beards of old men dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women and the hints about old men and mothers and the offspring taken soon out of their laps what do you think has become of the young and old men and what do you think has become of the women and children they are alive and well somewhere the smallest sprout shows there is really no death and if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the end to arrest it and ceasd the moment life appeard all goes onward and outward nothing collapses and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier has any one supposed it lucky to be born i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die and i know it i pass death with the dying and birth with the new washd babe and am not containd between my hat and boots and peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good the earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth i am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and fathomless as myself they do not know how immortal but i know every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female for me those that have been boys and that love women for me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted for me the sweet heart and the old maid for me mothers and the mothers of mothers for me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears for me children and the begetters of children undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no and am around tenacious acquisitive tireless and cannot be shaken away the little one sleeps in its cradle i lift the gauze and look a long time and silently brush away flies with my hand the youngster and the red faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill i peeringly view them from the top the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom i witness the corpse with its dabbled hair i note where the pistol has fallen the blab of the pave tires of carts sluff of boot soles talk of the promenaders the heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor the snow sleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snow balls the hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rousd mobs the flap of the curtaind litter a sick man inside borne to the hospital the meeting of enemies the sudden oath the blows and fall the excited crowd the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes what groans of over fed or half starvd who fall sunstruck or in fits what exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes what living and buried speech is always vibrating here what howls restraind by decorum arrests of criminals slights adulterous offers made acceptances rejections with convex lips i mind them or the show or resonance of them i come and i depart the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready the dried grass of the harvest time loads the slow drawn wagon the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged the armfuls are packd to the sagging mow i am there i help i came stretchd atop of the load i felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other i jump from the cross beams and seize the clover and timothy and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night kindling a fire and broiling the fresh killd game falling asleep on the gatherd leaves with my dog and gun by my side the yankee clipper is under her sky sails she cuts the sparkle and scud my eyes settle the land i bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck the boatmen and clam diggers arose early and stopt for me i tuckd my trowser ends in my boots and went and had a good time you should have been with us that day round the chowder kettle i saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west the bride was a red girl her father and his friends sat near cross legged and dumbly smoking they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders on a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand she had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reachd to her feet the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile through the swung half door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him and brought water and filld a tub for his sweated body and bruisd feet and gave him a room that enterd from my own and gave him some coarse clean clothes and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passd north i had him sit next me at table my fire lock leand in the corner twenty eight young men bathe by the shore twenty eight young men and all so friendly twenty eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank she hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window which of the young men does she like the best ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her where are you off to lady for i see you you splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty ninth bather the rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them the beards of the young men glistend with wet it ran from their long hair little streams passd all over their bodies an unseen hand also passd over their bodies it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs the young men float on their backs their white bellies bulge to the sun they do not ask who seizes fast to them they do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch they do not think whom they souse with spray the butcher boy puts off his killing clothes or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market i loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break down blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil each has his main sledge they are all out there is a great heat in the fire from the cinder strewd threshold i follow their movements the lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms overhand the hammers swing overhand so slow overhand so sure they do not hasten each man hits in his place the negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses the block swags underneath on its tied over chain the negro that drives the long dray of the stone yard steady and tall he stands poisd on one leg on the string piece his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip band his glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead the sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black of his polishd and perfect limbs i behold the picturesque giant and love him and i do not stop there i go with the team also in me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as forward sluing to niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing absorbing all to myself and for this song oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade what is that you express in your eyes it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life my tread scares the wood drake and wood duck on my distant and day long ramble they rise together they slowly circle around i believe in those wingd purposes and acknowledge red yellow white playing within me and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else and the jay in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night ya honk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation the pert may suppose it meaningless but i listening close find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky the sharp hoofd moose of the north the cat on the house sill the chickadee the prairie dog the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats the brood of the turkey hen and she with her half spread wings i see in them and myself the same old law the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections they scorn the best i can do to relate them i am enamourd of growing out doors of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls and the drivers of horses i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out what is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is me me going in for my chances spending for vast returns adorning myself to bestow

of the friendship i take again that i walk up my stoop i pause to consider if it really be a morning glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books to behold the day break the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows the air tastes good to my palate hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding scooting obliquely high and low something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs seas of bright juice suffuse heaven the earth by the sky staid with the daily close of their junction the heavd challenge from the east that moment over my head the mocking taunt see then whether you shall be master dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun rise would kill me if i could not now and always send sun rise out of me we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach with the twirl of my tongue i encompass worlds and volumes of worlds speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself it provokes me forever it says sarcastically walt you contain enough why dont you let it out then come now i will not be tantalized you conceive too much of articulation do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded waiting in gloom protected by frost the dirt receding before my prophetical screams i underlying causes to balance them at last my knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things happiness which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day my final merit i refuse you i refuse putting from me what i really am encompass worlds but never try to encompass me i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you writing and talk do not prove me i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic now i will do nothing but listen to accrue what i hear into this song to let sounds contribute toward it i hear bravuras of birds bustle of growing wheat gossip of flames clack of sticks cooking my meals i hear the sound i love the sound of the human voice i hear all sounds running together combined fused or following sounds of the city and sounds out of the city sounds of the day and night talkative young ones to those that like them the loud laugh of work people at their meals the angry base of disjointed friendship the faint tones of the sick the judge with hands tight to the desk his pallid lips pronouncing a death sentence the heaveeyo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the refrain of the anchor lifters the ring of alarm bells the cry of fire the whirr of swift streaking engines and hose carts with premonitory tinkles and colord lights the steam whistle the solid roll of the train of approaching cars the slow march playd at the head of the association marching two and two they go to guard some corpse the flag tops are draped with black muslin i hear the violoncello tis the young mans hearts complaint i hear the keyd cornet it glides quickly in through my ears it shakes mad sweet pangs through my belly and breast i hear the chorus it is a grand opera ah this indeed is music this suits me a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full i hear the traind soprano what work with hers is this the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possessd them it sails me i dab with bare feet they are lickd by the indolent waves i am cut by bitter and angry hail i lose my breath steepd amid honeyd morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death at length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles and that we call being to be in any form what is that round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither if nothing lay more developd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough mine is no callous shell i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me i merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy to touch my person to some one elses is about as much as i can stand is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity flames and ether making a rush for my veins treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip behaving licentious toward me taking no denial depriving me of my best as for a purpose unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture fields immodestly sliding the fellow senses away they bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me no consideration no regard for my draining strength or my anger fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me the sentries desert every other part of me they have left me helpless to a red marauder they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me i am given up by traitors i talk wildly i have lost my wits i and nobody else am the greatest traitor i went myself first to the headland my own hands carried me there you villain touch what are you doing my breath is tight in its throat unclench your floodgates you are too much for me blind loving wrestling touch sheathd hooded sharp toothd touch did it make you ache so leaving me parting trackd by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan rich showering rain and recompense richer afterward sprouts take and accumulate stand by the curb prolific and vital landscapes projected masculine full sized and golden all truths wait in all things they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon the insignificant is as big to me as any what is less or more than a touch logic and sermons never convince the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul only what proves itself to every man and woman is so only what nobody denies is so a minute and a drop of me settle my brain i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman and a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other and they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific and until one and all shall delight us and we them i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars and the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the egg of the wren and the tree toad is a chef d uvre for the highest and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery and the cow crunching with depressd head surpasses any statue and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels i find i incorporate gneiss coal long threaded moss fruits grains esculent roots and am stuccod with quadrupeds and birds all over and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons but call any thing back again when i desire it in vain the speeding or shyness in vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach in vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powderd bones in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes in vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low in vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods in vain the razor billd auk sails far north to labrador i follow quickly i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff i think i could turn and live with animals they are so placid and self containd i stand and look at them long and long they do not sweat and whine about their condition they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of owning things not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth so they show their relations to me and i accept them they bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their possession i wonder where they get those tokens did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them myself moving forward then and now and forever gathering and showing more always and with velocity infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers picking out here one that i love and now go with him on brotherly terms a gigantic beauty of a stallion fresh and responsive to my caresses head high in the forehead wide between the ears limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground eyes full of sparkling wickedness ears finely cut flexibly moving his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him his well built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return i but use you a minute then i resign you stallion why do i need your paces when i myself out gallop them even as i stand or sit passing faster than you space and time now i see it is true what i guessd at what i guessd when i loafd on the grass what i guessd while i lay alone in my bed and again as i walkd the beach under the paling stars of the morning my ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in sea gaps i skirt sierras my palms cover continents i am afoot with my vision by the citys quadrangular houses in log huts camping with lumbermen along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed weeding my onion patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips crossing savannas trailing in forests prospecting gold digging girdling the trees of a new purchase scorchd ankle deep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the shallow river where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the buck turns furiously at the hunter where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the otter is feeding on fish where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle shaped tail over the growing sugar over the yellow flowerd cotton plant over the rice in its low moist field over the sharp peakd farm house with its scallopd scum and slender shoots from the gutters over the western persimmon over the long leavd corn over the delicate blue flower flax over the white and brown buckwheat a hummer and buzzer there with the rest over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by low scragged limbs walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat lot where the bat flies in the seventh month eve where the great gold bug drops through the dark where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides where the cheese cloth hangs in the kitchen where andirons straddle the hearth slab where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters where trip hammers crash where the press is whirling its cylinders wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs where the pear shaped balloon is floating aloft floating in it myself and looking composedly down where the life car is drawn on the slip noose where the heat hatches pale green eggs in the dented sand where the she whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it where the steam ship trails hind ways its long pennant of smoke where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water where the half burnd brig is riding on unknown currents where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below where the dense starrd flag is borne at the head of the regiments approaching manhattan up by the long stretching island under niagara the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance upon a door step upon the horse block of hard wood outside upon the race course or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base ball at he festivals with blackguard gibes ironical license bull dances drinking laughter at the cider mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash sucking the juice through a straw at apple peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find at musters beach parties friendly bees huskings house raisings where the mocking bird sounds his delicious gurgles cackles screams weeps where the hay rick stands in the barn yard where the dry stalks are scatterd where the brood cow waits in the hovel where the bull advances to do his masculine work where the stud to the mare where the cock is treading the hen where the heifers browse where geese nip their food with short jerks where sun down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near where the humming bird shimmers where the neck of the long lived swan is curving and winding where the laughing gull scoots by the shore where she laughs her near human laugh where bee hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds where band neckd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out where burial coaches enter the archd gates of a cemetery where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees where the yellow crownd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon where the katy did works her chromatic reed on the walnut tree over the well through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver wired leaves through the salt lick or orange glade or under conical firs through the gymnasium through the curtaind saloon through the office or public hall pleasd with the native and pleasd with the foreign pleasd with the new and old pleasd with the homely woman as well as the handsome pleasd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously pleasd with the tune of the choir of the whitewashd church pleasd with the earnest words of the sweating methodist preacher impressd seriously at the camp meeting looking in at the shop windows of broadway the whole forenoon flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass wandering the same afternoon with my face turnd up to the clouds or down a lane or along the beach my right and left arms round the sides of two friends and i in the middle coming home with the silent and dark cheekd bush boy behind me he rides at the drape of the day far from the settlements studying the print of animals feet or the moccasin print by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient nigh the coffind corpse when all is still examining with a candle voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any hot toward one i hate ready in my madness to knife him solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while walking the old hills of jud a with the beautiful gentle god by my side speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the diameter of eighty thousand miles speeding with taild meteors throwing fire balls like the rest carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly storming enjoying planning loving cautioning backing and filling appearing and disappearing i tread day and night such roads i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product and look at quintillions ripend and look at quintillions green i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul my course runs below the soundings of plummets i help myself to material and immaterial no guard can shut me off no law prevent me i anchor my ship for a little while only my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me i go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a pike pointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue i ascend to the foretruck i take my place late at night in the crows nest we sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them the scenery is plain in all directions the white topt mountains show in the distance i fling out my fancies toward them we are approaching some great battle field in which we are soon to be engaged we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still feet and caution or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruind city the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe i am a free companion i bivouac by invading watchfires i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips my voice is the wifes voice the screech by the rail of the stairs they fetch my mans body up dripping and drownd i understand the large hearts of heroes the courage of present times and all times how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam ship and death chasing it up and down the storm how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of days and faithful of nights and chalkd in large letters on a board be of good cheer we will not desert you how he followd with them and tackd with them three days and would not give it up how he saved the drifting company at last how the lank loose gownd women lookd when boated from the side of their prepared graves how the silent old faced infants and the lifted sick and the sharp lippd unshaved men all this i swallow it tastes good i like it well it becomes mine i am the man i sufferd i was there the disdain and calmness of martyrs the mother of old condemnd for a witch burnt with dry wood her children gazing on the hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence blowing coverd with sweat the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderous buckshot and the bullets all these i feel or am i am the hounded slave i wince at the bite of the dogs hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen i clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinnd with the ooze of my skin i fall on the weeds and stones the riders spur their unwilling horses haul close taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip stocks agonies are one of my changes of garments i do not ask the wounded person how he feels i myself become the wounded person my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe i am the mashd fireman with breast bone broken tumbling walls buried me in their debris heat and smoke i inspired i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels they have cleard the beams away they tenderly lift me forth i lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy white and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared of their fire caps the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches distant and dead resuscitate they show as the dial or move as the hands of me i am the clock myself i am an old artillerist i tell of my forts bombardment i am there again again the long roll of the drummers again the attacking cannon mortars again to my listening ears the cannon responsive i take part i see and hear the whole the cries curses roar the plaudits for well aimd shots the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs the fall of grenades through the rent roof the fan shaped explosion the whizz of limbs heads stone wood iron high in the air again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves with his hand he gasps through the clot mind not me mind the entrenchments now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth i tell not the fall of alamo not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men retreating they had formd in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemys nine times their number was the price they took in advance their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone they treated for an honorable capitulation receivd writing and seal gave up their arms and marchd back prisoners of war they were the glory of the race of rangers matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters not a single one over thirty years of age the second first day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred it was beautiful early summer the work commenced about five oclock and was over by eight none obeyd the command to kneel some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight a few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and dead lay together the maimd and mangled dug in the dirt the new comers saw them there some half killd attempted to crawl away these were despatchd with bayonets or batterd with the blunts of muskets a youth not seventeen years old seizd his assassin till two more came to release him the three were all torn and coverd with the boys blood at eleven oclock began the burning of the bodies that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men would you hear of an old time sea fight would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars list to the yarn as my grandmothers father the sailor told it to me our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you said he his was the surly english pluck and there is no tougher or truer and never was and never will be along the lowerd eve he came horribly raking us we closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touchd my captain lashd fast with his own hands we had receivd some eighteen pound shots under the water on our lower gun deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire killing all around and blowing up overhead fighting at sun down fighting at dark ten oclock at night the full moon well up our leaks on the gain and five feet of water reported the master at arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after hold to give them a chance for themselves the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust our frigate takes fire the other asks if we demand quarter if our colors are struck and the fighting done now i laugh content for i hear the voice of my little captain we have not struck he composedly cries we have just begun our part of the fighting only three guns are in use one is directed by the captain himself against the enemys mainmast two well servd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks the tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially the main top they hold out bravely during the whole of the action not a moments cease the leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powder magazine one of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking serene stands the little captain he is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low his eyes give more light to us than our battle lanterns toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us stretchd and still lies the midnight two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness our vessel riddled and slowly sinking preparations to pass to the one we have conquerd the captain on the quarter deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet near by the corpse of the child that servd in the cabin the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curld whiskers the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars cut of cordage dangle of rigging slight shock of the soothe of waves black and impassive guns litter of powder parcels strong scent a few large stars overhead silent and mournful shining delicate sniffs of sea breeze smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore death messages given in charge to survivors the hiss of the surgeons knife the gnawing teeth of his saw wheeze cluck swash of falling blood short wild scream and long dull tapering groan these so these irretrievable you laggards there on guard look to your arms in at the conquerd doors they crowd i am possessd embody all presences outlawd or suffering see myself in prison shaped like another man and feel the dull unintermitted pain for me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch it is i let out in the morning and barrd at night not a mutineer walks handcuffd to jail but i am handcuffd to him and walk by his side i am less the jolly one there and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too and am tried and sentenced not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the last gasp my face is ash colord my sinews gnarl away from me people retreat askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied

help for the sick as they pant on their backs and for strong upright men i bring yet more needed help i heard what was said of the universe heard it and heard it of several thousand years it is middling well as far as it goes but is that all magnifying and applying come i outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters taking myself the exact dimensions of jehovah lithographing kronos zeus his son and hercules his grandson buying drafts of osiris isis belus brahma buddha in my portfolio placing manito loose allah on a leaf the crucifix engraved with odin and the hideous faced mexitli and every idol and image taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more admitting they were alive and did the work of their days they bore mites as for unfledgd birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself bestowing them freely on each man and woman i see discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house putting higher claims for him there with his rolld up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel not objecting to special revelations considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation lads ahold of fire engines and hook and ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction their brawny limbs passing safe over charrd laths their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames by the mechanics wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts baggd out at their waists the snag toothd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come selling all he possesses traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery what was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me and not filling the square rod then the bull and the bug never worshippd half enough dung and dirt more admirable than was dreamd the supernatural of no account myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes the day getting ready for me when i shall do as much good as the best and be as prodigious by my life lumps becoming already a creator putting myself here and now to the ambushd womb of the shadows a call in the midst of the crowd my own voice orotund sweeping and final come my children come my boys and girls my women household and intimates now the performer launches his nerve he has passd his prelude on the reeds within easily written loose fingerd chords i feel the thrum of your climax and close my head slues round on my neck music rolls but not from the organ folks are around me but they are no household of mine ever the hard unsunk ground ever the eaters and drinkers ever the upward and downward sun ever the air and the ceaseless tides ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real ever the old inexplicable query ever that thornd thumb that breath of itches and thirsts ever the vexers hoot hoot till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death here and there with dimes on the eyes walking to feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning tickets buying taking selling but in to the feast never once going many sweating ploughing thrashing and then the chaff for payment receiving a few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming this is the city and i am one of the citizens whatever interests the rest interests me politics wars markets newspapers schools the mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factories stocks stores real estate and personal estate the little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and taild coats i am aware who they are they are positively not worms or fleas i acknowledge the duplicates of myself the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me what i do and say the same waits for them every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them i know perfectly well my own egotism know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less and would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself not words of routine this song of mine but abruptly to question to leap beyond yet nearer bring this printed and bound book but the printer and the printing office boy the well taken photographs but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms the black ship maild with iron her mighty guns in her turrets but the pluck of the captain and engineers in the houses the dishes and fare and furniture but the host and hostess and the look out of their eyes the sky up there yet here or next door or across the way the saints and sages in history but you yourself sermons creeds theology but the fathomless human brain and what is reason and what is love and what is life i do not despise you priests all time the world over my faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern believing i shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks in the circle of obis helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist drinking mead from the skull cup to shastas and vedas admirant minding the koran walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knife beating the serpent skin drum accepting the gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing assuredly that he is divine to the mass kneeling or the puritans prayer rising or sitting patiently in a pew ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting dead like till my spirit arouses me looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey down hearted doubters dull and excluded frivolous sullen moping angry affected disheartend atheistical i know every one of you i know the sea of torment doubt despair and unbelief how the flukes splash how they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers i take my place among you as much as among any the past is the push of you me all precisely the same and what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all precisely the same i do not know what is untried and afterward but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail each who passes is considerd each who stops is considerd not a single one can it fail it cannot fail the young man who died and was buried nor the young woman who died and was put by his side nor the little child that peepd in at the door and then drew back and was never seen again nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with bitterness worse than gall nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder nor the numberless slaughterd and wreckd nor the brutish koboo calld the ordure of humanity nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them nor the present nor the least wisp that is known it is time to explain myself let us stand up what is known i strip away i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown the clock indicates the moment but what does eternity indicate we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them births have brought us richness and variety and other births will bring us richness and variety i do not call one greater and one smaller that which fills its period and place is equal to any were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister i am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation what have i to do with lamentation i am an acme of things accomplishd and i an encloser of things to be my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs on every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps all below duly traveld and still i mount and mount rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist and took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon long i was huggd close long and long immense have been the preparations for me faithful and friendly the arms that have helpd me cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings they sent influences to look after what was to hold me before i was born out of my mother generations guided me my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it for it the nebula cohered to an orb the long slow strata piled to rest it on vast vegetables gave it sustenance monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care all forces have been steadily employd to complete and delight me now on this spot i stand with my robust soul o span of youth ever pushd elasticity o manhood balanced florid and full my lovers suffocate me crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night crying by day ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging and chirping over my head calling my name from flower beds vines tangled underbrush lighting on every moment of my life bussing my body with soft balsamic busses noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine old age superbly rising o welcome ineffable grace of dying days every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows after and out of itself and the dark hush promulges as much as any i open my scuttle at night and see the far sprinkled systems and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding outward and outward and forever outward my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit and greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage if i you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would not avail in the long run we should surely bring up again where we now stand and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do not hazard the span or make it impatient they are but parts any thing is but a part see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that count ever so much there is limitless time around that my rendezvous is appointed it is certain the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there i know i have the best of time and space and was never measured and never will be measured i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all my signs are a rain proof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair i have no chair no church no philosophy i lead no man to a dinner table library exchange but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll my left hand hooking you round the waist my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road not i not any one else can travel that road for you you must travel it for yourself it is not far it is within reach perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land shoulder your duds dear son and i will mine and let us hasten forth wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go if you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip and in due time you shall repay the same service to me for after we start we never lie by again this day before dawn i ascended a hill and lookd at the crowded heaven and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we be filld and satisfied then and my spirit said no we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond you are also asking me questions and i hear you i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself sit a while dear son here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes i kiss you with a good by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence long enough have you dreamd contemptible dreams now i wash the gum from your eyes you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore now i will you to be a bold swimmer to jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout and laughingly dash with your hair i am the teacher of athletes he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own right wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts first rate to ride to fight to hit the bulls eye to sail a skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small pox over all latherers and those well tannd to those that keep out of the sun i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me i follow you whoever you are from the present hour my words itch at your ears till you understand them i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while i wait for a boat it is you talking just as much as myself i act as the tongue of you tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosend i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house and i swear i will never translate myself at all only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air if you would understand me go to the heights or water shore the nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves a key the maul the oar the hand saw second my words no shutterd room or school can commune with me but roughs and little children better than they the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day the farm boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice in vessels that sail my words sail i go with fishermen and seamen and love them the soldier campd or upon the march is mine on the night ere the pending battle many seek me and i do not fail them on that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me my face rubs to the hunters face when he lies down alone in his blanket the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon the young mother and old mother comprehend me the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are they and all would resume what i have told them i have said that the soul is not more than the body and i have said that the body is not more than the soul and nothing not god is greater to one than ones self is and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeld universe and i say to any man or woman let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes and i say to mankind be not curious about god for i who am curious about each am not curious about god no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and about death i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself why should i wish to see god better than this day i see something of god each hour of the twenty four and each moment then in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass i find letters from god dropt in the street and every one is signd by gods name and i leave them where they are for i know that wheresoeer i go others will punctually come for ever and ever and as to you death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to try to alarm me to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes i see the elder hand pressing receiving supporting i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape and as to you corpse i think you are good manure but that does not offend me i smell the white roses sweet scented and growing i reach to the leafy lips i reach to the polishd breasts of melons and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven o suns o grass of graves o perpetual transfers and promotions if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight toss sparkles of day and dusk toss on the black stems that decay in the muck toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small there is that in me i do not know what it is but i know it is in me wrenchd and sweaty calm and cool then my body becomes i sleep i sleep long i do not know it it is without name it is a word unsaid it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol something it swings on more than the earth i swing on to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me perhaps i might tell more outlines i plead for my brothers and sisters do you see o my brothers and sisters it is not chaos or death it is form union plan it is eternal life it is happiness the past and present wilt i have filld them emptied them and proceed to fill my next fold of the future listener up there what have you to confide to me look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening talk honestly no one else hears you and i stay only a minute longer do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the door slab who has done his days work who will soonest be through with his supper who wishes to walk with me will you speak before i am gone will you prove already too late the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gab and my loitering i too am not a bit tamed i too am untranslatable i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world the last scud of day holds back for me it flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadowd wilds it coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk i depart as air i shake my white locks at the runaway sun i effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love if you want me again look for me under your boot soles you will hardly know who i am or what i mean but i shall be good health to you nevertheless and filter and fibre your blood failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged missing me one place search another i stop somewhere waiting for you the foyer is hers because the kettle is hers as it was made for water and the water is hers because the sac that grew the baby was hers though the semen that made the sac was his like his boots are his and the tea thats of the kettle after it enters his mouth is his unless its hers since its inside the kitchen thats hers and therefore not his unless hes simmering the asian sauces that are his because theyre dense and knotty rather than milkish and paltry like everything else from the nation state of the motherland of the no mercy child who wont stop sucking and wanting and whining in the ear that is his although the child herself belongs somehow to the woman and thus its hunger is hers as is the bed and dresser and mirror and latch though the hammer naturally is his and the saw and lumber and back and muscle he suffered to build because he guessed he thought it would be good for something besides this house like a pestilence of people who werent his because nothing was his except the whirl he carried in his belly of the mix up of loving her in the first place like being sucked into a burrow of lava embers and putting your tongue to it until it caught fire and all he could say was that the burn was his this hole in the mouth this fiasco of the woman bent now in the garden to smell the cilantro as though she didnt know his head was split with hating her and loving her and hating her and loving her because she was an ache and a kink and somehow the furrow the groove and the rut and age and death and kiss and fuck and not fuck and song and not song and no it was not sweet though hed go on and carry it since also since mostly it was a girl who in when i was living by myself painfully lonely bereft depressed offhandedly mentioned to me in a conversation with some friends that although at first shed found me i cant remember the term some dated colloquialism signifying odd unacceptable out of things shed decided that i was after all all right twelve years later she comes back to me from nowhere and i realize that it wasnt my then irrepressible unselective incessant sexual want she meant which when wed been introduced id naturally aimed at her and which shed easily deflected but that shed thought i really was in myself the way i looked and spoke and acted what she was saying creepy weird whatever and i am taken with a terrible humiliation one morn before me were three figures seen with bow d necks and join d hands side faced and one behind the other steppd serene in placid sandals and in white robes graced they passd like figures on a marble urn when shifted round to see the other side they came again as when the urn once more is shifted round the first seen shades return and they were strange to me as may betide with vases to one deep in phidian lore how is it shadows that i knew ye not how came ye muffled in so hush a mask was it a silent deep disguis d plot to steal away and leave without a task my idle days ripe was the drowsy hour the blissful cloud of summer indolence benumbd my eyes my pulse grew less and less pain had no sting and pleasures wreath no flower o why did ye not melt and leave my sense unhaunted quite of all but nothingness a third time passd they by and passing turnd each one the face a moment whiles to me then faded and to follow them i burnd and ached for wings because i knew the three the first was a fair maid and love her name the second was ambition pale of cheek and ever watchful with fatigu d eye the last whom i love more the more of blame is heapd upon her maiden most unmeek i knew to be my demon poesy they faded and forsooth i wanted wings o folly what is love and where is it and for that poor ambition it springs from a mans little hearts short fever fit for poesy no she has not a joy at least for me so sweet as drowsy noons and evenings steepd in honeyd indolence o for an age so shelterd from annoy that i may never know how change the moons or hear the voice of busy common sense and once more came they by alas wherefore my sleep had been embroiderd with dim dreams my soul had been a lawn besprinkled oer with flowers and stirring shades and baffled beams the morn was clouded but no shower fell tho in her lids hung the sweet tears of may the open casement pressd a new leaved vine let in the budding warmth and throstles lay o shadows twas a time to bid farewell upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine so ye three ghosts adieu ye cannot raise my head cool bedded in the flowery grass for i would not be dieted with praise a pet lamb in a sentimental farce fade softly from my eyes and be once more in masque like figures on the dreamy urn farewell i yet have visions for the night and for the day faint visions there is store vanish ye phantoms from my idle spright into the clouds and never more return their long skirts and high heels battled away depending on the grounds and breezes whim at times some stocking shone low on the limb too soon concealed tickling our na vet at times as well an envious bug would bite our lovelies necks beneath the boughs and we would glimpse a flash white flash ah ecstasy and glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight evening would fall the autumn day would draw to its uncertain close our belles would cling dreamingly to us cooing whispering lies that still set our souls trembling with awe learning to love differently is hard love with the hands wide open love with the doors banging on their hinges the cupboard unlocked the wind roaring and whimpering in the rooms rustling the sheets and snapping the blinds that thwack like rubber bands in an open palm it hurts to love wide open stretching the muscles that feel as if they are made of wet plaster then of blunt knives then of sharp knives it hurts to thwart the reflexes of grab of clutch to love and let go again and again it pesters to remember the lover who is not in the bed to hold back what is owed to the work that gutters like a candle in a cave without air to love consciously conscientiously concretely constructively i cant do it you say its killing me but you thrive you glow on the street like a neon raspberry you float and sail a helium balloon bright bachelors button blue and bobbing on the cold and hot winds of our breath as we make and unmake in passionate diastole and systole the rhythm of our unbound bonding to have and not to hold to love with minimized malice hunger and anger moment by moment balanced wyatt resteth here that quick could never rest whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain and virtue sank the deeper in his breast such profit he of envy could obtain a head where wisdom mysteries did frame whose hammers beat still in that lively brain as on a stith where some work of fame was daily wrought to turn to britains gain a visage stern and mild where both did grow vice to condemn in virtues to rejoice amid great storms whom grace assured so to live upright and smile at fortunes choice a hand that taught what might be said in rhyme that reft chaucer the glory of his wit a mark the which unperfited for time some may approach but never none shall hit a tongue that served in foreign realms his king whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame each noble heart a worthy guide to bring our english youth by travail unto fame an eye whose judgment no affect could blind friends to allure and foes to reconcile whose piercing look did represent a mind with virtue fraught reposed void of guile a heart where dread yet never so impressed to hide the thought that might the truth avaunce in neither fortune lift nor so repressed to swell in wealth nor yield unto mischance a valiant corps where force and beauty met happy alas too happy but for foes lived and ran the race that nature set of manhoods shape where she the mold did lose but to the heavens that simple soul is fled which left with such as covet christ to know witness of faith that never shall be dead sent for our health but not received so thus for our guilt this jewel have we lost the earth his bones the heavens possess his ghost amen could you come back to me douglas douglas in the old likeness that i knew i would be so faithful so loving douglas douglas douglas

me keeps me and him in one my heart in him his thoughts and senses guides he loves my heart for once it was his own i cherish his because in me it bides his heart his wound received from my sight my heart was wounded with his wounded heart for as from me on him his hurt did light so still methought in me his hurt did smart both equal hurt in this change sought our bliss my true love hath my heart

bitten half winged i see you once ive got you down to size a two day stubble squatter jailbait eyes the bottle headed trophy mom the mentoralways angling his face down from the centerof his universe to shine a light on yours the fated anorexic whose alluresshimmer in the mirror for her eyesonly denying what her denial denies once you become a cliche i can hate you or treat me tenderly and let me date you but that only retards the writing offthat comes with boredom amour propre or cough irreconcilable differences i e those things about you that are least like me yet just slightly different my foibles homophone so in hating yours i really hate my own this keeps the focus where it wants to be on whom you ask invariably on see i didnt even have to say did i i love you so much no need to reply love is the kindest expression of absence or else is a day by the river in which by motion it becomes clear there have been in an hour an infinite train of rivers which did you want to see one comes slowly to realize there is no evading things the heart will have its way though its will go unfulfilled there is no shame in this the pleasures in this world soft breeze soft thighs a bit of music words that make a good sound suggest when taken whole that the thing the body longs for is not never has been some petite mort a true thing known to grass the elderly man with a kind word in greeting and the woman saying that she is about to come as in going to arrive at last to fill the body held so long by stewards in her name stay i said to the cut flowers they bowed their heads lower stay i said to the spider who fled stay leaf it reddened embarrassed for me and itself stay i said to my body it sat as a dog does obedient for a moment soon starting to tremble stay to the earth of riverine valley meadows of fossiled escarpments of limestone and sandstone it looked back with a changing expression in silence stay i said to my loves each answered always i loathe that i did love in youth that i thought sweet as time requires for my behove methinks they are not meet my lusts they do me leave my fancies all be fled and tract of time begins to weave grey hairs upon my head for age with stealing steps hath clawed me with his crutch and lusty life away she leaps as there had been none such my muse doth not delight me as she did before my hand and pen are not in plight as they have been of yore for reason me denies this youthly idle rhyme and day by day to me she cries leave off these toys in time the wrinkles in my brow the furrows in my face say limping age will lodge him now where youth must give him place the harbinger of death to me i see him ride the cough the cold the gasping breath doth bid me provide a pickaxe and a spade and eke a shrouding sheet a house of clay for to be made for such a guest most meet methinks i hear the clark that knolls the careful knell and bids me leave my woeful wark ere nature me compel my keepers knit the knot that youth did laugh to scorn of me that clean shall be forgot as i had not been born thus must i youth give up whose badge i long did wear to them i yield the wanton cup that better may it bear lo here the bar d skull by whose bald sign i know that stooping age away shall pull which youthful years did sow for beauty with her band these crooked cares hath wrought and shipp d me into the land from whence i first was brought and ye that bide behind have ye none other trust as ye of clay were cast by kind so shall ye waste to dust i stood inside myself like a dead tree or a tower i pulled the rope of braided hair and high above me a bell of leaves tolled because my hand stabbed its brother i said make it stone because my tongue spoke harshly i said make it dust and yet it was not death but her body in its green dress i longed for thats why i stood for days in the field until the grass turned black and the rain came you put on an ornate ballgown you say someone has to do it you take me to where you work the inside of a pyramid with chasms watching the complex train track changes products and objects make love to my father two babies are born bruno and daisy you take your shirt off looking boylike lovely you get on the plane both clown wizard and then get off in a comedy of manners our dates become a comedy of dinners your name rhymes with clothes your plane folds flies away without us ill make the next one we are enclosed in spaceless epics by breathless bricks still well meet like runes or the leashes for hawks lets go can we stay go to sleep a tree wouldnt talk or weep if i forget what and you in the trains opulent rooms switch your cock to a baby and then say must there not be a law against this you add i have been thinking of you in my head you wear green glitter on your shirt instead of a tie thats how i recognize you as you you are the prep cook the sous chef you make duplicating potato salad like the loaves fishes you create gorgeous paper like sculptures of foods we go down in the car through threatening snows to arrive in a second to eat in a renovated place you and i tell what we are at the end of a movie our podium of soft loud feet flies by accident i take the train to your house to hear shakespeare verdi everyone applauds when you walk in the director holds up each actor describes his physical being i talk to your father but only by telephone you have the royal blue x notebook with the lock on it i want one but you say you cant get them anymore i walk twice through that city ive been in before all through its rooms its streets and its commons while he lives heres a list of images light in a filthy glass pigeon dead on the high spiked window clear plastic bag above him full of water if water could kill everything that lives in you it can i sit in a corner of the cancer ward fingering the app that shows me other faggots in this hospital chat with one i might meet in radiology but dont instead make the sick man laugh while hes conscious compliment his gown his new brutal cheekbones that appeared with the chemo if only it were simple as a magnet sucking the bad metals out of him if only i could make a better list more magic less language periphrastic restorative if only i met that stranger in the basement our pleasure rose through the hospital bliss poultice for the sorrow skinned who sit half conscious half machinery while the sick man lives all i can do is recount the vast pastoral of his illness when he is gone im counting on all the good flooding back his beard a collapsed country ill refuge inside his laugh a memory so liquid ill hear it when anyone opens a window to scare the birds to have gold in your back yard and not know it i woke this morning before your dream had shredded and found a curious thing flowers made of gold six sided more than that broken on flagstones petals the color of a wedding band you are sleeping the morning comes up gold perhaps i made those flowers in my head for i have counted snowflakes in july blowing across my eyes like bits of calcium and i have stepped into your dream at night a stranger there my body steeped in moonlight i watched you tremble washed in all that silver love the stars have fallen into the garden and turned to frost they have opened like a hand it is the color that breaks out of the bedsheets this morning the garden is littered with dry petals as yellow as the page of an old book i step among them they are brittle as bone china we arent differentiable with bangs and hooded lids i know the likeness doesnt stop right there whats so great about being horny the joke is insatiable it rips and roars between and through we both have found our mothers jewels buried in closets rolled in silk thread and bunting done in scarlet fortunately found never for the men in sharing these are our secrets our punch lines and couplets i went to bed thinking pixies the bliss and after math of a spiritual kiss how you resonate without rooms maintaining perfect valences where is the disaster at the end of this dread in my dream state you were queen a reigning bodhisattva without a sprig i climbed inside your belly punched inside you laughed and laughed converting persimmons into a freedom jelly slathered all over i found us exuberant happy to swing or go both ways fresh spring the herald of loves mighty king in whose cote armour richly are displayed all sorts of flowers the which on earth do spring in goodly colours gloriously arrayd goe to my love where she is carelesse layd yet in her winters bowre not well awake tell her the joyous time wil not be staid unless she doe him by the forelock take bid her therefore her selfe soone ready make to wayt on love amongst his lovely crew where every one that misseth then her make shall be by him amearst with penance dew make hast therefore sweet love whilest it is prime for none can call againe the pass d time let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandring bark whose worths unknown although his height be taken loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me provd i never writ nor no man ever lovd their jeans sparkled cut off way above the knee and my friends and i would watch them from my porch books of poems lost in our laps eyes wide as tropical fish behind our glasses their football flashed from hand to hand tennis shoes gripped the asphalt sweats spotlight on their strong backs we would dream of hugging them and crouch later in weird rooms and come once their ball fell our way so two of them came over hands on their hips asking us to throw it to them which arthur did badly and they chased it back one turned to yell thanks and we dreamed of his long teeth in our necks we wanted them to wander over place deep wet underarms to our lips and then their white asses then those loud mouths one day one guy was very tired didnt move fast enough so a car hit him and he sprawled fifty feet away sexy but he was dead blood like lipstick then those great boys stood together on the sidewalk and we joined them mixing in like one big friendship to the cops who asked if we were and those boys were too sad to counter wed known his name tim and how hed turned to thank us nicely but now he was under a sheet anonymous as god the big boys crying spitting words and we stunned like intellectuals get our high voices soft as the tinkling of a chandelier on a ceiling too high to see they call it sacrifice imagine me a tiny poppy on a field of green felt brief blip of color limitless expanse ive never felt foreign or like a lash in his eye if its not love its very like most days it feels the same exacting he tweezes the stray thoughts from my speech cleans up my heart with a tortoiseshell comb every lady should have such a man edging her lawn with a sharp rotary blade year by year lets call it always editor and editrix engaged against a flurry of typos showered in revisionist white out i erase his crows feet buff away his frown my head he yawns it open scoops out dark foam yesses ive regretted the tiny poppy everyone sees flapping to pieces and so we are growing taller sweeter ratified in the glow of the big correction maybe you need to write a poem about grace when everything broken is broken and everything dead is dead and the hero has looked into the mirror with complete contempt and the heroine has studied her face and its defects remorselessly and the pain they thought might as a token of their earnestness release them from themselves has lost its novelty and not released them and they have begun to think kindly and distantly watching the others go about their days likes and dislikes reasons habits fears that self love is the one weedy stalk of every human blossoming and understood therefore why they had been all their lives in such a fury to defend it and that no one except some almost inconceivable saint in his pool of poverty and silence can escape this violent automatic lifes companion ever maybe then ordinary light faint music under things a hovering like grace appears as in the story a friend told once about the time he tried to kill himself his girl had left him bees in the heart then scorpions maggots and then ash he climbed onto the jumping girder of the bridge the bay side a blue lucid afternoon and in the salt air he thought about the word seafood that there was something faintly ridiculous about it no one said landfood he thought it was degrading to the rainbow perch hed reeled in gleaming from the cliffs the black rockbass scales like polished carbon in beds of kelp along the coast and he realized that the reason for the word was crabs or mussels clams otherwise the restaurants could just put fish up on their signs and when he woke hed slept for hours curled up on the girder like a child the sun was going down and he felt a little better and afraid he put on the jacket hed used for a pillow climbed over the railing carefully and drove home to an empty house there was a pair of her lemon yellow panties hanging on a doorknob he studied them much washed a faint russet in the crotch that made him sick with rage and grief he knew more or less where she was a flat somewhere on russian hill theyd have just finished making love shed have tears in her eyes and touch his jawbone gratefully god shed say you are so good for me winking lights a foggy view downhill toward the harbor and the bay youre sad hed say yes thinking about nick yes shed say and cry i tried so hard sobbing now i really tried so hard and then hed hold her for a while guatemalan weavings from his fieldwork on the wall and then theyd fuck again and she would cry some more and go to sleep and he he would play that scene once only once and a half and tell himself that he was going to carry it for a very long time and that there was nothing he could do but carry it he went out onto the porch and listened to the forest in the summer dark madrone bark cracking and curling as the cold came up its not the story though not the friend leaning toward you saying and then i realized which is the part of stories one never quite believes i had the idea that the worlds so full of pain it must sometimes make a kind of singing and that the sequence helps as much as order helps first an ego and then pain and then the singing what do you remember when i looked at his streaky glasses i wanted to leave him and before that he stole those cherries for me at midnight we were walking in the rain and i loved him and before that i saw him coming toward me that time at the picnic edgy foreign but you loved him he sat in his room with the shades drawn brooding but youloved him he gave me a photo of himself at sixteen diving from the pier it was summer his arms outstretched and before that his mother was combing his soft curls with her fingers and crying crying is that what he said he put on the straw hat and raced me to the barn what did hetell you heres the dried rose brown as tobacco heres the letter that i tore and pasted the book of blank pages with the velvet cover but do you still love him when i rub the nap backwards the colors lift bristle what do you mean sometimes when im all alone i find myself stroking it my heart is bleeding it bleeds upward and fills my mouth up with salt it bleeds because of a city in ruins the chair still warm from sisters body because it will all be irreproducible my heart bleeds because of baby bear not finding mama bear and it bleeds to the tips of my fingers like i painted my nails crimson sometimes my heart bleeds so much i am a raisin it bleeds until i am a quivering ragged clot bleeds at the ending with the heroine and her sunken cancer eyes at the ending with the plaintive flute over smoke choked killing fields im bleeding a river of blood right now and its wearing a culvert in me for the blood my heart rises up in me becomes the cork of me and i choke on it i am bleeding for you and for me and for the tiny babies and the ied blown leg it bleeds because im made that way all filled up with blood my sloppy heart a sponge filled with blood to squeeze onto any circumstance because it is mine it will always bleed my heart bled today it bled onto the streets and the steps of city hall it bled in the pizza parlor with the useless jukebox ive got so much blood to give inside and outside of any milieu even for a bad zoning decision ill bleed so much youll be bleeding all of us bleeding in and out like its breathing or kissing and because it is righteous and terrible and red he crawls through the cracks of my stone foundation sly and sleek as i tempt him with food he stays out of habit i cook out of love for things that move we grow accustomed to each others trails and smells the skins weve shed along the long long road of rubbing each other smooth till all the skins weve shed lie sparkling like so many stones in this desert land i scoop him up in my hand and eat him no one loves you more more more there were sincere lies everywhere placed directly beforethe next step does everyone pretend part of alivei am proposing words all structures have crumbled in earliest death im crossing the yellow sandsits so hard to know without relating it to youshaping a heart take hold of me and someone saysi dont get it you dont have to have love or you do which i dont think you do beforethe explosion i was here without it and have been inmany places loveless i dont want youto know what im really thinking or do i beforecreation when there might be no i knew everything ones ever said not quite true he or she be trays you why you want to hurt me badwant to or just do treason was provokedeverywhere even here by knowing one was one andi was alone a pale hue the sky of deathis milky green today like a poison pool near adesert mine picked prickly pear fruit and itasted it then we drove on maybe to yarnell these outposts where i grew up i didnt do thati have no identity and the love is an objectto kick as you walk on the blazing bare ground where sentimental when what i love i dont have that oneword this fire all there is to find i find ityou have to find it it isnt love its what before the days of self service when you never had to pump your own gas i was the one who did it for you the girl who stepped out at the sound of a bell with a blue rag in my hand my hair pulled back in a straight unlovely ponytail this was before automatic shut offs and vapor seals and once while filling a tank i hit a bubble of trapped air and the gas backed up came arcing out of the hole in a bright gold wave and soaked me face breasts belly and legs and i had to hurry back to the booth the small employee bathroom with the broken lock to change my uniform peel the gas soaked cloth from my skin and wash myself in the sink light headed scrubbed raw i felt pure and amazed the way the amber gas glazed my flesh the searing subterranean pain of it how my skin shimmered and ached glowed like rainbowed oil on the pavement i was twenty in a few weeks i would fall for the first time in love that man waiting patiently in my future like a red leaf on the sidewalk the kind of beauty that asks to be noticed how was i to know it would begin this way every cell of my body burning with a dangerous beauty the air around me a nimbus of light that would carry me through the days how when he found me weeks later he would find me like that an ordinary woman who could rise in flame all he would have to do is come close and touch me zipping your skirt you rustle past sand hissing through a glass with the bedouin snap and flashof static electricsparks disturbing fabric this mornings charge could rousethe desert fathers of sinaiover which i drowse poised upside down on its duncecap a shrunken purple head true blueberry enters its tightening frame of orange lip and the cream of a childs cheek is daubed with zanzibar cocoa while here at the martha washington ice cream store we outdo the symbolistes a fine green trickle pistachio mint julep words have colors and colors are tasty sweetens his chin in front of me licorice teeters like a lump of coal on its pinkish base of pumpkin a rauschenberg tongue fondles this rich donn e then begins to erase it turning from all that is present in the flesh so to speak let the eye wander off to a menu where it can start to ingest quite sour lemon sherbet topped with a stem cherry and chocolate sprinkles swilling in language all floating in bubbly cherry phosphate the bloated imagination is urged to open still wider and shovel it in and served with a twist of pretzel in this world creamy vanilla and smooth swiss chocolate ice creams can be blended with chopped pineapple dark fudge sauce ripe bananas whipped topping cookies roasted nutmeats and nippy chopped cherries the unconscious that old hog being in charge here of the creative act at about the moment my tastebuds receive a last tickle of gingersnap and begin to respond to orange fudge i look at you who have bought my ice cream cones for twenty years moving another new ice to the mouth we neednt remember and look away it is always the same mouth that melts it my mind assembles a ribald tower of sherbet dips all on one cone apricot apple tangerine peach prune lime and then it topples you are steadier than i you order one dip always or in a dish two dips of the same flavor in this hysterical brilliance of neon come on consumers weve got to keep scooping it is twelve or fifteen of us to thirty ice creams so that the creams shall not rise like cold lava out of their bins numbing our feet our knees freezing our chests our chins our eyes open the door quick and let in two handholding adolescents coping with all those glands makes them good and hungry so that flying out of their cannisters the chopped nuts shall not top off our technicolor grave with their oily ashes listen all around us toothsome cones are suffering demolition down to the last nipple like tip how do we know where to stop perhaps the glasses and dishes are moulded of candy and the counters and windows over your half eaten serving of italian delight why are you looking at me the way you are looking at me there was a time when i watched it happen strangers pressed to other strangers in one bed clothes on air humid with the cloying scent of fruit juice and vodka none of us giving into another and yet unwilling to leave the scene of that possibility pretending to sleep actually sleeping then waking again to slip a hand over a shoulder slide a finger inside the waistband of a skirt so young we are even now still so young in that hotel room turning blue then lighter blue we wouldnt have tried for more the kiss the button firm white shape of an image slipped wholly into the mind acted upon dreamed upon filling the thin vessels of the lungs earlier a film its forced sounds of lovemaking the tension i felt winding into the muscles of some of the others in the room i remember i left for awhile we all left for awhile even the music was frightening how to strip ourselves like that point at the places that were wanted plucked and peeled speaking the words hearing them form us the nature of what we were and could do to each other the music the rocking the sobbing the man called the woman by parts of herself some laughed at this i remember i must have been one of them in the morning the hotel room was turning white after the long night hands were slipping and unslipping moving over the flattened pillows as if in hopes something small could still satisfy us someone turned and looked at someone else we all heard it legs shifted sheets slid themselves down waists or shoulders tightened again at the necks of those pretending to sleep as the unblinking sun crawled in our window from another room coughing we all heard it someone looked at someone else the room turned white the air began clearing at last i know its on old ivory jars glassed with old miniatures and garnered once with musk ive seen those eyes like smouldering april stars as carp might see them behind their bubbled skies in pale green fishponds theyre as green your eyes as lakes themselves changed to green stone at dusk at last i know its paned in a crystal hoop on powder boxes from some dead italian girl ive seen such eyes grow suddenly dark and droop their small pure lids as if id pried too far in finding you snared there on that ivory jar by crusted motes of rose and smoky pearl o mary at thy window be it is the wishd the trysted hour those smiles and glances let me see that makes the misers treasure poor how blythely wad i bide the stoure a weary slave frae sun to sun could i the rich reward secure the lovely mary morison yestreen when to the trembling string the dance gaed thro the lighted ha to thee my fancy took its wing i sat but neither heard nor saw tho this was fair and that was braw and yon the toast of a the town i sighd and said amang them a ye are na mary morison o mary canst thou wreck his peace wha for thy sake wad gladly die or canst thou break that heart of his whase only faut is loving thee if love for love thou wilt na gie at least be pity to me shown a thought ungentle canna be the thought o mary morison no i wasnt meant to love and be loved if id lived longer i would have waited longer knowing you are faithless keeps me alive and hungry knowing you faithful would kill me with joy delicate are you and your vows are delicate too so easily do they break you are a laconic marksman you leave me not dead but perpetually dying i want my friends to heal me succor me instead i get analysis conflagrations that would make stones drip blood are campfires compared to my anguish two headed inescapable anguish loves anguish or the anguish of time another dark severing incommunicable night death would be fine if i only died once i would have liked a solitary death not this lavish funeral this grave anyone can visit you are mystical ghalib and also you speak beautifully are you a saint or just drunk as usual and ye shall walk in silk attire and siller hae to spare gin yell consent to be his bride nor think o donald mair o wha wad buy a silken goun wi a poor broken heart or whats to me a siller croun gin frae my love i part the mind whas every wish is pure far dearer is to me and ere im forcd to break my faith ill lay me down an dee for i hae pledgd my virgin troth brave

langest life can neer repay the love he bears to me and ere im forcd to break my troth ill lay me doun an dee comes the time when its later and onto your table the headwaiter puts the bill and very soon after rings out the sound of lively laughter picking up change hands like a walrus and a face like a barndoors and a head without any apparent size nothing but two eyes so thats you man or me i make it as i can i pick up i go faster than they know out the door the street like a night any night and no one in sight but then well there she is old friend liz and she opens the door of her cadillac i step in back and were gone she turns me on there are very huge stars man in the sky and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie with a gob of white white ice cream on top of it and i eat it slowly and while certainly they are laughing at me and all around me is racket of these cats not making it i make it in my wicker basket and yet we think that song outlasts us all wrecked devotion the wept face of desire a kind of savage caring that reseeds itself and grows in clusters oh you who are young consider how quickly the body deranges itself how time the cruel banker forecloses us to snowdrifts white as gods own ribs what else but to linger in the slight shade of those sapling branches yearning for that vernal beau for dont birds covet the seeds of the honey locust and doesnt the ewe have a nose for wet filaree and slender oats foraged in the meadow kit foxes crave the blacktailed hare how this longing grabs me by the nape guess i figured to be done with desire if i could write it out dispense with any evidence the way one burns a pile of twigs and brush what was his name id ask myself that guy with the sideburns and charming smile the one i hoped that as from a sip of hemlock id expire with him on my tongue silly poet silly man thought i could master nature like a misguided preacher as if banishing love is a fix as if the stars go out when we shut our sleepy eyes for haines eason o heart the equal poise of loves both parts big alike with wounds and darts live in these conquering leaves live all the same and walk through all tongues one triumphant flame live here great heart and love and die and kill and bleed and wound and yield and conquer still let this immortal life whereer it comes walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms let mystic deaths wait on t and wise souls be the love slain witnesses of this life of thee o sweet incendiary show here thy art upon this carcass of a hard cold heart let all thy scatterd shafts of light that play among the leaves of thy large books of day combind against this breast at once break in and take away from me my self and sin this gracious robbery shall thy bounty be and my best fortunes such fair spoils of me o thou undaunted daughter of desires by all thy dowr of lights and fires by all the eagle in thee all the dove by all thy lives and deaths of love by thy large draughts of intellectual day and by thy thirsts of love more large than they by all thy brim filld bowls of fierce desire by thy last mornings draught of liquid fire by the full kingdom of that final kiss that seizd thy parting soul and seald thee his by all the heavns thou hast in him fair sister of the seraphim by all of him we have in thee leave nothing of my self in me let me so read thy life that i unto all life of mine may die no more alone sleeping no more alone waking thy dreams divided thy prayers in twain thy merry sisters tonight forsaking never shall we see maiden again never shall we see thee thine eyes glancing flashing with laughter and wild in glee under the mistletoe kissing and dancing wantonly free there shall come a matron walking sedately low voiced gentle wise in reply tell me o tell me can i love her greatly all for her sake must the maiden die i of choice despair is big with friends i love hydrogen and burning jews i give them all the grief i have but i tell them friends i choose i choose dont make me say against my glands or how the world has treated me though gay and modest give offense and people grieve pretentiously more than i hoped to do i do and more than i deserve i get what little i attend i know and it argues order more than not my desperate friends i want to tell them you take too delicate offense at the stench of time and mans own smell it is only the smell of consequence ii of love people love each other and the light of love gilds but doesnt alter people dont change one another can scarcely by taking will and thought add a little now and then to their own statures which praise them they do so that here we are in all our sizes flooded in the impartial daylight sometimes spotted sometimes in a light we make ourselves human the beams of attention of social animals at their work which is loving and sometimes all dark the only correction is by you of you by me of me people are worth looking at in this light and if you listen what they are saying is love me sun out there whoever you are chasing me from bed in the morning spooking me all day with shadow surprising me whenever you fall make me conspicuous as i go here spotted by however many beams now light finally dark i fear there is meant to be a lot of darkness you hear them say but every last creature is the one it meant to be iii my acts the acts of my life swarm down the street like puerto rican kids foreign but small and except for one unknived they do no harm though their voices slash like reeds all except one they have evidently been loved and down the hill where ive planted spruce and red pine in a gang of spiked shadows they slouch at night i am reasonably brave i have been except on one occasion myself it is no good trying to be what you are not we live among gangs who seem to have no stake in what were trying to do no sense of property or race yet if you speak with authority they will halt and break and sullenly one by one show you a local face i dreamt once that they caught me and holding me down burned my genitals with gasoline in my stupid terror i was telling them names so my manhood kept and the rest went up in flames now say the world is a fair place the biggest one said and because there was no face worse than my own there i said it and got up quite a lot of me is charred by our code it is fair we play fair the world is fair so she said sipping tea from a chinese oxblood cup did anything good happen because of your divorce well my emotional palette is wider now it includescolors like i paused like that i pointed to the cup in southeast winnemucca bypass route connects two segments of route i love you and is resigned as route although route is never erotically part of route quite a price to pay for a palette but i heard munchsjust went for at sothebys in london i heard that too i think he used a color like oxbloodwhen he painted the scream im in better shape if love now reigned as it hath been and were rewarded as it hath sin noble men then would sure ensearch all ways whereby they might it reach but envy reigneth with such disdain and causeth lovers outwardly to refrain which puts them to more and more inwardly most grievous and sore the fault in whom i cannot set but let them tell which love doth get to lovers i put now sure this case which of their loves doth get them grace and unto them which doth it know better than do i i think it so good barber of the pea i exhumed high into the vag where the barber keeps his pea good sprout his mouth his gray hunted tongue always in the distance no use denying we master the particular service we deny ourselves in the shade of this pea the sum of his shade and the gavel flexing above his head i will become a milliner to cover what work ive done or else ill begin anew at the infant chin where nothing grows but chins outside snails vines surpass me and must gaining pews upon pews but dont think for a sec i dont know the way out of here that release is one hair spiral stair top of which cleavage evaporates oakland make it the place it was then so full it split vision to live there in winter so late wet abundance toppled toward awful birds of paradise a profusion the ripe colors of anodized metal in gutters umbrellas smashed like pigeons bent ribs bright among black slack fluttering camellias pink imagoes dropping into water rotting sweet stink did not stop the inundated eye over populous urban eye the whole place to look at it was a footprint in january everywhere cloudy water rising to fill in the outlines meanwhile indoors differed by degree alone without love loosed from god there were lovers touch rushing in to redraw your boundaries constantly because it was a tune you kept getting wrong the refrain of what it meant to live alone months of that and then sudden summer sheer release streets all cigarettes sashay balls out tube tops low riders belly fat the girls on the block all like oh no she didnt and girl she did she was mad skills with press ons a cell phone telling him where to stick it a kid on her hip just like that summer sheer beauty lip gloss that smelled like peaches you going to the store for whiskey condoms like everyone else on a hot long afternoon so long hot it would just be sunburn to walk anywhere if it werent also a pleasure thoughtless shiftless horny drunk just someone thinking summer wasnt up to anything deep lo there he was his punk ass pink as a viking in a tight wifebeater lingering by the public pool drinking beer so sly it didnt look illegal he wasnt a good idea but did you have a light it seemed the whole summer went like that taking fire out of your pocket giving it away a ditty you could whistle it was so clich like the numbers they gave you after you never called the number of swollen nodes of the kissing colds you got later the number to call to get tested the number of the bus to the clinic the number they gave you when they asked you to wait the number of questions asked number of partners number of risks number of previous tests the number of pricks one to draw the blood the number of minutes you waited before results then you decided you had to get the tune right the how to live it so it doesnt kill you to take a number wait in the long line of the citys bankrupt humanism like the bus that never comes no matter how long you wait the grocery bag breaking if you were going to sing that one the one that sounds like all i got is bruised tomatoes broken glass dirty bread no one waiting at home would you start with genius as in the spirit of a place small as in of the back wet in heat the urge to touch him there skin just visible between his jeans t shirt to see if hes sweating to see if he feels what you feel if he does is that all the spirit the place will give a small thing shared just a phrase not a whole song but something to build on if it isnt bread if it sure aint tomatoes it isnt empty is it like the signage you walk by that fronts the lakeside church of practical christianity hawking a knowledge of god so modest it seems trivial it isnt ever is it the how to live it so it doesnt kill you the where to touch it the when will genius sing your name so it sounds like a place you can live every morning i look for you on the menu where are your eyes and lips my side order of thighs im so hungry for the sauce of you and the way your blouse opens like a flame at once this dragnet of cousins whips its way into your presence saying none of them among us they are oracles on the court of midnight the tight filigree of a mind or your splashing around in your pandemonium of copper graffiti inexpertly put up they make weapons of furled hands we will walk but our bones will carry ribbons of lead or we will like acrobats mill headed in s blades hips tongues answer to what comes before what comes before eleousa master of dark eyelids eye opening like a fennel seed you are generous or are you not do you shore up and wink at the soul what does the soul say other than my divorce from tan holiday smoking crystal in teak rooms but should have asked what do you see the sun a sequence of fans a bridge only so exquisitely cabled as to make us still shall we fall or travel between bridges among the robust sane clouds a face cut from smoke heat and light the sun dancing in a vial the initial memory of what it was to be born doberman of a sheer white universe to school out the audacity of rising without name or color to new rooms new youth fruitful born singularly to precise moments not in epiphany but duration as under new weather we become in action receive our bodies uncasked like umbrellas under the flamingo red light of the racing day my love is as a fever longing stillfor that which longer nurseth the disease feeding on that which doth preserve the ill th uncertain sickly appetite to please my reason the physician to my love angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me and i desperate now approvedesire is death which physic did except past cure i am now reason is past care and frantic mad with evermore unrest my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are at random from the truth vainly expressed for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night when awful darkness and silence reign over the great gromboolian plain through the long long wintry nights when the angry breakers roar as they beat on the rocky shore when storm clouds brood on the towering heights of the hills of the chankly bore then through the vast and gloomy dark there moves what seems a fiery spark a lonely spark with silvery rays piercing the coal black night a meteor strange and bright hither and thither the vision strays a single lurid light slowly it wander pauses creeps anon it sparkles flashes and leaps and ever as onward it gleaming goes a light on the bong tree stems it throws and those who watch at that midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as the wild light passes along the dong the dong the wandering dong through the forest goes the dong the dong the dong with a luminous nose long years ago the dong was happy and gay till he fell in love with a jumbly girl who came to those shores one day for the jumblies came in a sieve they did landing at eve near the zemmery fidd where the oblong oysters grow and the rocks are smooth and gray and all the woods and the valleys rang with the chorus they daily and nightly sang far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blueand they went to sea in a sieve happily happily passed those days while the cheerful jumblies staid they danced in circlets all night long to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong in moonlight shine or shade for day and night he was always there by the side of the jumbly girl so fair with her sky blue hands and her sea green hair till the morning came of that hateful day when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away and the dong was left on the cruel shore gazing gazing for evermore ever keeping his weary eyes on that pea green sail on the far horizon singing the jumbly chorus still as he sate all day on the grassy hill far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blueand they went to sea in a sieve but when the sun was low in the west the dong arose and said what little sense i once possessed has quite gone out of my head and since that day he wanders still by lake and dorest marsh and hills singing o somewhere in valley or plain might i find my jumbly girl again for ever ill seek by lake and shore till i find my jumbly girl once more playing a pipe with silvery squeaks since then his jumbly girl he seeks and because by night he could not see he gathered the bark of the twangum tree on the flowery plain that grows and he wove him a wondrous nose a nose as strange as a nose could be of vast proportions and painted red and tied with cords to the back of his head in a hollow rounded space it ended with a luminous lamp within suspended all fenced about with a bandage stout to prevent the wind from blowing it out and with holes all round to send the light in gleaming rays on the dismal night and now each night and all night long over those plains still roams the dong and above the wail of the chimp and snipe you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe while ever he seeks but seeks in vain to meet with his jumbly girl again lonely and wild all night he goes the dong with a luminous nose and all who watch at the midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as they trace the meteor bright moving along through the dreary night this is the hour when forth he goes the dong with a luminous nose yonder over the plain he goes he goes he goes the dong with a luminous nose time only cause of my unrestby whom i hopd once to bee blest how cruell art thou turned that first gavst lyfe unto my love and still a pleasure nott to move or change though ever burned have i thee slackd or left undunone loving rite and soe have wunn thy rage or bitter changing that now noe minutes i shall see wherein i

butt joy for what she giveth in the bath i look up and see the brown moth pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips against the white wall i heat up the water running as much hot in as i can stand these handfuls over my shoulder how once he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring we were drinking from beautiful mischief that stills a moment so i can never look back only now brightest now and the water never hot enough to drive that shiver out but i remember solitude no other presence and each thing what it was not this raw fluttering i make of you as you have made of me your watch fire your killing light you are like me you will die too but not today you incommensurate therefore the hours shine if i say to you to you i say you have not been set to music or broadcast live on the ghost radio may never be an oil painting or old masters charcoal sketch you are a concordance of person number voice and place strawberries spread through your name as if it were budding shrubs how you remind me of some spring the waters as cool and clear late rain clings to your leaves shaken by light wind which is where you occur in grassy moonlight and you are a lily an aster white trillium or viburnum by all rights mine white star in the meadow sky the snow still arriving from its earthwards journeys here where there is no snow i dreamed the snow was you when there was snow you are my right have come to be my night your body takes on the dimensions of sleep the shape of sleep becomes you and you fall from the sky with several flowers words spill from your mouth in waves your lips taste like the sea salt sweet trees and seas have flown away i call it loving you home is nowhere therefore you a kind of dwell and welcome song after all and free of any eden we can name maurice weep not i am not here under this pine tree the balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass the stars sparkle the whippoorwill calls but thou grievest while my soul lies rapturous in the blest nirvana of eternal light go to the good heart that is my husband who broods upon what he calls our guilty love i tell him that my love for you no less than my love for him wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh i won spirit and through spirit peace there is no marriage in heaven but there is love a poet am i neither born nor bred but to a witty poet married whose brain is fresh and pleasant as the spring where fancies grow and where the muses sing there oft i lean my head and listening hark to catch his words and all his fancies mark and from that garden show of beauties takewhereof a posy i in verse may make thus i that have no gardens of my own there gather flowers that are newly blown each time we moved to a new apartment and we did three times i knew i shouldnt that i should leave while i had the chance but each time we moved to a new apartment we were desperate had been kicked out or priced out and we only had one bed no savings just friends some of whom knew that you fractured your hand punching through a wall inches from my head and some of whom were aware that you threw things at me when i said things you didnt like as if my words were things i threw at you first it made sense to you i cant remember the bad things i said my self serving memory enraged you and why not i always remembered the bad things you did and yes i do remember everything you threw a chair over our heads at a bar liz was there a mirror like a frisbee aimed at my knees a carton of fried rice that splat on the shade of our only nice lamp oil stains patterned it with tiny bugs also you threw me against a wall but you always said it was because i made you so mad because you loved me so much and didnt want to lose me that youd lose control instead and later beg me to stay that if i left you it meant you would never be loved and i couldnt bear to have you think that about either one of us i wasnt someone whod let herself be hit id never take that from a man a man would be a criminal if he did what you did but you had been hurt and all that pain and anger needed more time and i made you so crazy i was so stubborn and good at mean words what else were you supposed to do you liked to raise your fist pretending to hit me and then half smile when i winced or cringed it was important that you had never actually hit me never punched me with a closed fist youd only grabbed me and choked me and flung me and made dents in the wall next to me and narrowly missed me but we knew you meant to miss never truly meant to clobber me on the head with something heavy something light maybe like a book i loved when a woman you love hits you on the head with a book you love is that love i was so ashamed and afraid someone would find out about us then i was afraid and ashamed people already knew but didnt know what to do did i really think this was a secret not from the cops we called during two bad fights or from peggy who let you stay with her rent free that month i kicked you out you two had a blast but i couldnt pay the rent on my own so you moved back in triumphant peggy still in love with you and you gloated about how much money youd saved surrounded by friends whom could i tell why would i tell anyone who didnt already know us well enough to already know if everyone knew none of us said so we talked all of us almost constantly intimately so how did we keep ourselves so quiet you and i together in this were alone with this alone among women who loved us the two of us never more alone than when together come to me in the silence of the night come in the speaking silence of a dream come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright as sunlight on a stream come back in tears o memory hope love of finished years oh dream how sweet too sweet too bitter sweet whose wakening should have been in paradise where souls brimfull of love abide and meet where thirsting longing eyes watch the slow door that opening letting in lets out no more yet come to me in dreams that i may live my very life again tho cold in death come back to me in dreams that i may give pulse for pulse breath for breath speak low lean low as long ago my love how long ago we dine at adorno and return to my beauvoir she compliments me on my bachelard pad i pop in a santayana cd and saussure back to the couch on my way i pull out two fine kristeva wine glasses i pour some merleau ponty and return the aristotle to descartes after pausing an unamuno i wrap my arm around her hegel her hair smells of wild lukacs and labriola our small talk expands to include dewey moore and kant i confess to her whats in my eckhart we locke by this point were totally blavatsky we stretch out on the schopenhauer she slips out of her lyotard and i fumble with my levi strauss she unhooks her buber and i pull off my spinoza i run my finger along her heraclitus as she fondles my bacon she stops to ask me if i brought any kierkegaard i nod we foucault she lights a cigarette and compares foucault to lacan i roll over and derrida in love it may be dangerous to reckon on time to count on it times here and then its gone im not thinking of death or disaster but of the slippage the unpredictable disappearance of days on which we were depending for happiness wipe away tears set free your fears everything is free only the lonely need much money everything is free dont try to bind the love you find everyone is free your lovers yours surrender force everyone is free the sun melts down spreads gold around everything is free the rain is spent lending flowers scent everything is free the love you live the life you give everything is free how difficult it is to say goodbye to scourge for years we were obsessed with you your complex glycoproteins and your sly haphazard reproduction your restraint in your resistance how you bathed so slight yet fierce in our most intimate secretions we will remember you for generations electron micrographs of you seem quaint already in the moment of our victory how difficult it is to claim ones right to living honestly the honesty you taught was nothing quite as true as death but neither was it final yes we vanquished you with latex protease inhibitors a little common sense whats that you say that some remain at risk how dare you try to threaten us again of course youd like to make outrageous claims that some behaviors havent changed that some have not had access to the drugs that mask your presence in the body difficult it is how very sad to see you strain no pun intended at response our quilts our bravest poetry our deaths with grace and dignity have put you in your place this elegy itself renounces you as from this consciousness youve been erased the love for you was very strong the hot pursuits so many of us reveled in but what once felt like love was really not i hardly know what i will find to hate as much as i have loved and hated what you brought to bear upon my verse the weight of your oppression and the joys of truth how difficult it is to face the white of nothingness of clarity we win some that have deeper diggd loves mine than i say where his centric happiness doth lie i have lovd and got and told but should i love get tell till i were old i should not find that hidden mystery oh tis imposture all and as no chemic yet thelixir got but glorifies his pregnant pot if by the way to him befall some odoriferous thing or medicinal so lovers dream a rich and long delight but get a winter seeming summers night our ease our thrift our honour and our day shall we for this vain bubbles shadow pay ends love in this that my man can be as happyas i can if he can endure the short scorn of a bridegrooms play that loving wretch that swears tis not the bodies marry but the minds which he in her angelic finds would swear as justly that he hears in that days rude hoarse minstrelsy the spheres hope not for mind in women at their best sweetness and wit theyare but mummy possessd the chinese concubine feeling has left and the sky hovers like the preparation of a revolutionary speech you my long walk with all that expectation the sexy lunches thousands of them and then all that religion of eroticism beneath the squeeze on my heart is a stranglehold you like a little italian porcelain village thats all over the shop window saying admire this image of foreverness the red scarf is factory made but silky and its what id flutter over your face if you were here and it would be cheap greasy hypnotism my own malarkey and wed be on the southside at the boat docks and id kiss you beside the stretch of a russian grain ship its hammer and sickle like the sending out of rescue choppers a translator who has a phobia of

contained a greater variety of moths than the original drawn from suggestions she had made some of which were in facttoo perfect and changed back before it went to print her moths the ones that were too aptly named meant too much her moths that she hated where are they now the same place as all the versions of peoplethat have been undressed and slept with in lieu of the peoplethemselves by others

radiator grill groaned gave off a lesser chill so that we could take off our coats the pipes coughed to clear their throats our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves we cherished each our minor griefs to keep them warm until the night when it was time again to fight but we were young did not need much to make us laugh instead and touch and could not hear ourselves above the arias of death and love go lovely rose tell her that wastes her time and me that now she knows when i resemble her to thee how sweet and fair she seems to be tell her thats young and shuns to have her graces spied that hadst thou sprung in deserts where no men abide thou must have uncommended died small is the worth of beauty from the light retired bid her come forth suffer herself to be desired and not blush so to be admired then die that she the common fate of all things rare may read in thee how small a part of time they share that are so wondrous sweet and fair let me call a ghost love so it be little in december we took no thought for the weather whom now shall i thank for this wealth of water your heart loves harbors where i am a stranger where was it we lay needing no other twelve days and twelve nights in each others eyes or was it at babel and the days too small we spoke our own tongue needing no other if a seed grow green set a stone upon it that it learn thereby holy charity if you must smile always on that other cut me from ear to ear and we all smile together carefully folded swooned postpartum posthaste my letter to you i gave curious you said uncanny you said the color of my eyes in this light is a different shade of green said you dont eat meat but you wear leather outside the birds inside the sun on the chair my thighs spread stick to the plastic you said you loved it the ampersand my swoon silently inside my skirt the ochre on the building changes to umber in the light the tree outside is bare i am my foot inside my slipper my toes curled behind ow yes some days are sunny days some days are remember me when i am gone away gone far away into the silent land when you can no more hold me by the hand nor i half turn to go yet turning stay remember me when no more day by day you tell me of our future that you plannd only remember me you understand it will be late to counsel then or pray yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember do not grieve for if the darkness and corruption leave a vestige of the thoughts that once i had better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad thus every creature and of every kind the secret joys of sweet coition find not only mans imperial race but they that wing the liquid air or swim the sea or haunt the desert rush into the flame for love is lord of all and is in all the same tis with this rage the mother lion stung scours ore the plain regardless of her young demanding rites of love she sternly stalks and hunts her lover in his lonely walks tis then the shapeless bear his den forsakes in woods and fields a wild destruction makes boars whet their tusks to battle tygers move enragd with hunger more enragd with love then wo to him that in the desert land of lybia travels ore the burning sand the stallion snuffs the well known scent afar and snorts and trembles for the distant mare nor bitts nor bridles can his rage restrain and rugged rocks are interposd in vain he makes his way ore mountains and contemns unruly torrents and unfoorded streams the bristled boar who feels the pleasing wound new grinds his arming tusks and digs the ground the sleepy leacher shuts his little eyes about his churning chaps the frothy bubbles rise he rubs his sides against a tree prepares and hardens both his shoulders for the wars when love was a question the message arrived in the beak of a wire and plaster bird the coloratura was hardly to be believed for flight it took three stagehands two on the pulleys and one on the flute and you thought fancy rained

fibres between their toes the sandals gold and silver seem all alike how can the women tell them apart they do tell them apart it is as if each pair sings an intimate mantra to its owner audible only to her one day i too shall return to expectant slippers that stack up like the moon and the stars outside a marble building one day i shall not have to wear childs shoes sunday before school white sneakers seven years of these shoes are a chemical memory the convent ruled that pupils shoes must be white absolutely white who can imagine a s shoe that was absolutely white without any logo with no swoosh not a single slogan sunday evenings before the school week i crouched down on the pink bathroom tiles and painted my shoes into the absolute of whiteness like the alice in wonderland garden ers

to heels black ankle boots with four inch stacks for walking through snow french cream curved suede stilettos for scaling fire escape ladders on to rooftops to admire the winter sky even after i left him scarlet satin bedroom only spiky mules to amuse myself early on my ex said that the way women walk in heels looks ugly and my nails made unnatural social appearances emerald lacquer cobalt incarnadine sign of a bad marriage i began to wear flats the penitential mermaid shoes worn once and once only were a gabor creation distressed silver ballet slippers with netted and criss cross side details which would make the material seem to swish with the changes of light on feet that go walking cool as moonlight on a tourist coastline but the inner stitching hooked the softness of my skin which has always been too soft but i could not turn back for we had tickets to an evening of mozart but the paper tissues that i stuffed into my shoes failed to act as a protective lining paper tissue snow flecks teardropped with crimson blood created a trail behind me as i ascended the many tiers of the wedding cake concert hall barefoot pearl pink polish sitting next to someone can make my feet curl shy self destructive and oyster like they want to shuck their cases to present themselves little undersea pinks their skin still is too soft their toes still too long their ankles still too slender for a modern fit but he is not modern he sits like stone and my bare feet are cool they will not have to bleed i am offering this poem to you since i have nothing else to give keep it like a warm coat when winter comes to cover you or like a pair of thick socks the cold cannot bite through i love you i have nothing else to give you so it is a pot full of yellow corn to warm your belly in winter it is a scarf for your head to wear over your hair to tie up around your face i love you keep it treasure this as you would if you were lost needing direction in the wilderness life becomes when mature and in the corner of your drawer tucked away like a cabin or hogan in dense trees come knocking and i will answer give you directions and let you warm yourself by this fire rest by this fire and make you feel safe i love you its all i have to give and all anyone needs to live and to go on living inside when the world outside no longer cares if you live or die remember i love you i was conceived in the cruelest monthin whatever spring california could muster a little rain with some more likely and the buckeyes were they yet on the ground damn my fathers smooth stone eyes other prevailing enticements and what eliot calledthe female stench damn the oaks their histrionics struggling in the fog spiderwebs lay in the grass mistedand looking like misspent galaxies i cry into and out of this moment pound told eliot strike this and this what was weak got dropped and the poemstood stronger without it drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss but in the cup and ill not look for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of joves nectar sup i would not change for thine i sent thee late a rosy wreath not so much honouring thee as giving it a hope that there it could not withered be but thou thereon didst only breathe and sentst it back to me since when it grows and smells i swear not of itself but thee deola passes her mornings sitting in a cafe and nobody looks at her everyones rushing to work under a sun still fresh with the dawn even deola isnt looking for anyone she smokes serenely breathing the morning in years past she slept at this hour to recover her strength the throw on her bed was black with the boot prints of soldiers and workers the backbreaking clients but now on her own its different the works more refined and its easier like the gentleman yesterday who woke her up early kissed her and took her id stay awhile dear in turin with you if i could to the station to tell him goodbye shes dazed this morning but fresh deola likes being free likes drinking her milk and eating brioches this morning shes nearly a lady and if she looks at anyone now its just to pass the time the girls at the house are still sleeping the air stinks the madam goes out for a walk its crazy to stay there to work the bars in the evening you have to look good at that house by thirty youve lost what little looks you had left deola sits with her profile turned toward a mirror and looks at herself in the cool of the glass her face pale and not from the smoke her brow a bit furrowed to survive at that house youd need a will like mar used to have because honey these men come here to get something they cant get at home from their wives or their lovers and mar used to work tirelessly full of good cheer and blessed with good health the people who pass the cafe arent distracting deola she only works evenings making slow conquests to music in her usual bar shell make eyes at a client or nudge his foot while enjoying the band that makes her seem like an actress doing a love scene with a young millionaire one client each evening is enough to scrape by on maybe that gentleman from last night really will take me with him to be alone if she wants in the morning to sit in a caf to not look for anyone it was your birthday we had drunk and dined half of the night with our old friend whod showed us in the end to a bed i reached in one drunk stride already i lay snug and drowsy with the wine dozed on one side i dozed i slept my sleep broke on a hug suddenly from behind in which the full lengths of our bodies pressed your instep to my heel my shoulder blades against your chest it was not sex but i could feel the whole strength of your body set or braced to mine and locking me to you as if we were still twenty two when our grand passion had not yet become familial my quick sleep had deleted all of intervening time and place i only knew the stay of your secure firm dry embrace why damon why why why so pressing the heart you begs not worth possessing each look each word each smiles affected and inward charms are quite neglected then scorn her scorn her foolish swain and sigh no more no more in vain beautys worthless fading flying who would for trifles think of dying who for a face a shape woud languish and tell the brooks and groves his anguish till she till she thinks fit to prize him and all and all beside despise him fix fix your thoughts on whats inviting on what will never bear the slighting wit and virtue claim your duty theyre much more worth than gold and beauty to them to them your heart resign and youll no more no more repine i am saying primroses lined the pathway of toothless hedges i am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the morning sun the context of my story changes when you enter then i am dung on the wall of the nomad s field then the everyday waking person i am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur seeing in your manner i am speaking your pace slippage of silk slippers i say you are losing sight i say your breasts are dry shells i am afraid of what i am capable of doing this is all a manner of stating how i prepare myself to be loved love faded in my heart i thought it was dead now new flowers start fresh leaves outspread why do these flowers upstart and again the leaves spread oh when will it be dead this root that tears my heart avising the bright beams of these fair eyeswhere he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth the wearied mind straight from the heart departethfor to rest in his worldly paradiseand find the sweet bitter under this guise what webs he hath wrought well he perceivethwhereby with himself on love he plaineththat spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice thus is it in such extremity brought in frozen thought now and now it standeth in flame twixt misery and wealth twixt earnest and game but few glad and many diverse thoughtwith sore repentance of his hardiness of such a root cometh fruit fruitless why art thou silent is thy love a plant of such weak fibre that the treacherous air of absence withers what was once so fair is there no debt to pay no boon to grant yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant bound to thy service with unceasing care the minds least generous wish a mendicant for nought but what thy happiness could spare speak though this soft warm heart once free to hold a thousand tender pleasures thine and mine be left more desolate more dreary cold than a forsaken birds nest filled with snow mid its own bush of leafless eglantine speak that my torturing doubts their end may know he faked my death set up this ranch far from my three daughters suburban hellhole with bracelet on ankle house arrest at noon the bully sun shoulders a ripe moon in the dark soaps reign the anchors will often flash their glitterati weddings not one daughter has birthed an heir in vitro be damned i hose the lawn and count the cars like fish slipping their shiny chrome along asphalt which sparrow missed cordelia my gutted heart light so low upon earth you send a flash to the sun here is the golden close of love all my wooing is done oh all the woods and the meadows woods where we hid from the wet stiles where we stayed to be kind meadows in which we met light so low in the vale you flash and lighten afar for this is the golden morning of love and you are his morning star flash i am coming i come by meadow and stile and wood oh lighten into my eyes and my heart into my heart and my blood heart are you great enough for a love that never tires o heart are you great enough for love i have heard of thorns and briers over the thorns and briers over the meadows and stiles over the world to the end of it flash of a million miles a stranger came to the door at eve and he spoke the bridegroom fair he bore a green white stick in his hand and for all burden care he asked with the eyes more than the lips for a shelter for the night and he turned and looked at the road afar without a window light the bridegroom came forth into the porch with let us look at the sky and question what of the night to be stranger you and i the woodbine leaves littered the yard the woodbine berries were blue autumn yes winter was in the wind stranger i wish i knew within the bride in the dusk alone bent over the open fire her face rose red with the glowing coal and the thought of the hearts desire the bridegroom looked at the weary road yet saw but her within and wished her heart in a case of gold and pinned with a silver pin the bridegroom thought it little to give a dole of bread a purse a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god or for the rich a curse but whether or not a man was asked to mar the love of two by harboring woe in the bridal house the bridegroom wished he knew i am not of those miserable males who sniff at vice and daring not to snap do therefore hope for heaven i take the hap of all my deeds the wind that fills my sails propels but i am helmsman am i wrecked i know the devil has sufficient weight to bear i lay it not on him or fate besides hes damned that man i do suspect a coward who would burden the poor deuce with what ensues from his own slipperiness i have just found a wanton scented tress in an old desk dusty for lack of use of days and nights it is demonstrative that like some aged star gleam luridly if for those times i must ask charity have i not any charity to give the late gracie allen was a very lucid comedienne especially in the way that lucid means shining and bright what her husband george burns called her illogical logic made a halo around our syntax and ourselves as we laughed george burns most often was her artful inconspicuous straight man he could move people about stage construct skits and scenes write and gather jokes they were married as long as ordinary magic would allow thirty eight years until gracie allens death in her fifties gracie allen developed a heart condition she would call george burns when her heart felt funny and fluttered hed give her a pill and theyd hold each other till the palpitation stopped just a few minutes many times and pills as magic fills then fulfilled must leave a space one day gracie allens heart fluttered and hurt and stopped george burns said unbelievingly to the doctor but i still have some of the pills sir i am not a bird of prey a lady does not seize the day i trust that brief time will unfold our youth before he makes us old how could we two write lines of rhyme were we not fond of numbered time and grateful to the vast and sweet trials his days will make us meet the graves not just the bodys curse no skeleton can pen a verse so while this numbered world we see lets sweeten time with poetry and time in turn may sweeten love and give us time our love to prove youve praised my eyes forehead breast youve all our lives to praise the rest you put this pen in my hand and you take the pen from my hand the night before the full moon the moon seems full what is missing is a dark hungry sickle the sliver of shadow eating us up inside after the mountains breathe their mint and sorrow green against the long summer sky they burst into hot october laughter lighting the horizon with citrus rust and blood you put this knife in my hand we pull we meet as oceans come together heaving against and clinging across our salt watery boundary we approach endlessly like two rails of one track tied in a parallel that promises our eyes to merge someplace far off in the distance you put this feather in my palm my fingers close around flight wine comes in at the mouth and love comes in at the eye thats all we shall know for truth before we grow old and die i lift the glass to my mouth i look at you and i sigh the modern biographers worry how far it went their tender friendship they wonder just what it means when he writes he thinks of her constantly his guardian angel beloved friend the modern biographers ask the rude irrelevant question of our age as if the event of two bodies meshing together establishes the degree of love forgetting how softly eros walked in the nineteenth century how a hand held overlong or a gaze anchored in someones eyes could unseat a heart and nuances of address not known in our egalitarian language could make the redolent air tremble and shimmer with the heat of possibility each time i hear the intermezzi sad and lavish in their tenderness i imagine the two of them sitting in a garden among late blooming roses and dark cascades of leaves letting the landscape speak for them leaving us nothing to overhear my sweet did sweetly sleep and on her rosy face stood tears of pearl which beautys self did weep i wondring at her grace did all amazd remain when love said fool can looks thy wishes crown time past comes not again then did i me bow down and kissing her fair breast lips cheeks and eyes provd here on earth the joys of paradise

must have marveled at distances powerto deceive and to wake deceptions twin oblivion their women and homes forgotten you canthear their screams from here but theyre there when the strong drag of the boys adolescence pulls through them the family rises into thinness and begins to break like a wave you turned away when i kissed you the woman says why half lidded days of early winter when he points toward the woman the boy looks at his hand the way dogs will the boys jaw sets as though behind his teeth into the soft flesh of his throat a new set of teeth were cutting through a mouth for what each of them adopts a private view arguments veer every which way and who can follow a sequence of dark non sequiturs blows in when one when one word when the word suicide enters the room where they are shouting the system closes down prematurely becalmed the man writes i am not given a subject but am given to my subject i am inside it like a parasite he sees the womans face contract at the approach of other futures than the one for which her face was prepared so they inhabit their bodies like music for a given time and yet he continues to act as if there were times to come i just want you to go away one of them screams expressionless and flat as a tortilla the afternoon moon over their house she calls the man to a corner in the basement those arent spider eggs he says backing up those are its eyes when the encounter with the self is volcanic nothing can follow tearing open the cocoon to reveal itself a boy within the family as if they were waiting as if inside experience bright with meaning there were another experience pendant unnameable naked she lay clasped in my longing arms i filled with love and she all over charms both equally inspired with eager fire melting through kindness flaming in desire with arms legs lips close clinging to embrace she clips me to her breast and sucks me to her face her nimble tongue loves lesser lightning played within my mouth and to my thoughts conveyed swift orders that i should prepare to throw the all dissolving thunderbolt below my fluttering soul sprung with the pointed kiss hangs hovering oer her balmy brinks of bliss but whilst her busy hand would guide that part which should convey my soul up to her heart in liquid raptures i dissolve all oer melt into sperm and spend at every pore a touch from any part of her had done t her hand her foot her very looks a cunt smiling she chides in a kind murmuring noise and from her body wipes the clammy joys when with a thousand kisses wandering oer my panting bosom is there then no more she cries all this to love and raptures due must we not pay a debt to pleasure too but i the most forlorn lost man alive to show my wished obedience vainly strive i sigh alas and kiss but cannot swive eager desires confound my first intent succeeding shame does more success prevent and rage at last confirms me impotent evn her fair hand which might bid heat return to frozen age and make cold hermits burn applied to my dear cinder warms no more than fire to ashes could past flames restore trembling confused despairing limber dry a wishing weak unmoving lump i lie this dart of love whose piercing point oft tried with virgin blood ten thousand maids has dyed which nature still directed with such art that it through every cunt reached every heart stiffly resolved twould carelessly invade woman or man nor ought its fury stayed whereer it pierced a cunt it found or made now languid lies in this unhappy hour shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower thou treacherous base deserter of my flame false to my passion fatal to my fame through what mistaken magic dost thou prove so true to lewdness so untrue to love what oyster cinder beggar common whore didst thou eer fail in all thy life before when vice disease and scandal lead the way with what officious haste doest thou obey like a rude roaring hector in the streets who scuffles cuffs and justles all he meets but if his king or country claim his aid the rakehell villain shrinks and hides his head evn so thy brutal valor is displayed breaks every stew does each small whore invade but when great love the onset does command base recreant to thy prince thou darst not stand worst part of me and henceforth hated most through all the town a common fucking post on whom each whore relieves her tingling cunt as hogs on gates do rub themselves and grunt mayst thou to ravenous chancres be a prey or in consuming weepings waste away may strangury and stone thy days attend mayst thou never piss who didst refuse to spend when all my joys did on false thee depend and may ten thousand abler pricks agree to do the wronged corinna right for thee i was a man and i was trying to save a woman in danger i picked her up in my arms and flew flying like a frog swimming in air i ditched our nameless pursuer and landed there was a guy waiting for us who looked like a king caught now i have to accept the punishment for saving the woman first we have to take a shower the effect is to loosen the skin from the muscle until it peels off the woman picks up the pieces of my skin and holds them in her hands and says i will love each of theseas i loved you and i thought this is what is called fetish and suddenly it came to me that the origin of the word is fe as in female soft loving silken plus tissue like tissues flying voicing particles waking in waves over a living body of water loose at last our oneness is the wrestlers fierce and close thrusting and thrust one life in dual effort for one prize we fight and must for soul with soul does battle evermore till love be trust our distance is loves severance sense divides each is but each never the very hidden spirit of thee my life doth reach twain since love athwart the gulf that needs kisses and speech ah wrestle closelier we draw nearer so than any bliss can bring twain souls who would be whole and one too near to kiss to be one thought one voice before we die wrestle for this some things lock in competition like an earthquake and a kiss while a decision is waiting to be made neither side of the argument progresses the earthquake though eager to prove its claim shows valiant restraint the kiss it knows the power of bitten tongues such stand offs as these precede most gains stance of knowing too much and fearing too late the tongues shaking along with the house say nothing shattering at all with progress not only earthquakes but kisses will be predicted the last fine line between feeling and fact will choose a good point and end flattery will continue to make us immortal in the difficult years between the first word and the lost in which mary herself a palette of grays inhabitant of a universe void of color

with a dun and smooth interiority as a glass of rum might or a worn number on an apartment building his hands crossed on the chest rise and fall with breathing in the dream hes ringing the bell now climbing unlocking the door peering into a glass the flat is empty is the war over yet or was he here before the war soon dropping salt levels will wake him in tears with an odd groove in his palm as though hed held on to an instrument for hours for a good minute hell be nameless and when a name does come it wont be his humming in thought the bright last name he rang on the doorbell hell see in a certain abrupt sunlight hed chosen her then to be able to call everything something the face of all the world is changed i think since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul move still oh still beside me as they stole betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink of obvious death where i who thought to sink was caught up into love and taught the whole of life in a new rhythm the cup of dole god gave for baptism i am fain to drink and praise its sweetness sweet with thee anear the names of country heaven are changed away for where thou art or shalt be there or here and this this lute and song

tamalpais rise to adore the mystery of love an ode pindars art the editors tell us was not a statue but a mosaic an accumulation of metaphor but if he was archaic not classic a survival of obsolete

too far topples over listend to a tower that said listen to me the oracle had said despair the gods themselves abhor his power and then the virgin flower of the dark falls back flesh of our flesh from which everywhere the information flows that is yearning a line of pindar moves from the area of my lamp toward morning in the dawn that is nowhere i have seen the willful children clockwise and counter clockwise turning a black satin purse in her right hand condoms spermicide her key to the birdcage elevator all night thunder and rain in a flash of lightning his hands visible leaves of philodendron a half moon table they talk in near dark eating from a basket she places her hand in his lap opens her legs as if god came from her fragrance pluming like smoke all night his tongue like a fish philodendron green smoothing half light now the bridge is illuminated twin arches rising chalky incandescent light abandoning the dome of sky river breathing azure its surface frazzled the moon leaving her scuff marks near the open window dark of leaves outside at dawn the sun hidden a crow lowering itself on black wings crosses before windows as gold as rome the telephone her mouth open i can see all the way into you he says leaves of philodendron pour from the table love is like the wild rose briar friendship like the holly tree the holly is dark when the rose briar blooms but which will bloom most constantly the wild rose briar is sweet in spring its summer blossoms scent the air yet wait till winter comes again and who will call the wild briar fair then scorn the silly rose

frayed with careless use you wanted to say it was beginning to bother you beginning to wish wondering if thought in broken light could ever touch itself reassemble itself the king our promise broken the sword we imagined gone hovers like leafmold in the light say it then the stain of things remains iii at odds again elbow cupped into wet leaves after love there are moments of clutter and no amount of practice will teach you to regard them as anything more than what you lean against catching its buried chill keep your fancy to yourself facts do not fade but are momentarily obscured the work of hands touch and its out come the absence of touch and distance the inevitable space between shapes all our limitations iv at odds again knee raised slightly sunlight and shade patchwork coverlet bits and pieces the story of each thing connected end to end this instant extended in every direction not a thing in space or things in spaces or spaces between what space seems occupied for this moment the next we are not snowstorms of ourselves spindrift and curl the whorl of action is a template in time the casual shifting of leaves hands moving the certain flex of possibility love not too much but how when thou hast made me such and dost thy gifts bestow how can i love too much though i must fear to lose and drown my joy in care with all its thorns i choose the path of love and prayer though thou i know not why didst kill my childish trust that breach with toil did i repair because i must and spite of frighting schemes with which the fiends of hell blaspheme thee in my dreams so far i have hoped well but what the heavenly key what marvel in me wrought shall quite exculpate thee i have no shadow of thought what am i that complain the love from which began my question sad and vain justifies thee to man it seems to head from its last stop too fast my transbay trains strungout hoo deep inside the tunnel and starts to bleed into the baritone wail of that guy at platforms end a sort of lullaby rubbed against the wall then caught in a squall of wind darkening toward us his whippy voice skinning its tired song off the tiled dome hes determined the silky lyric says to be independently blue while we all wait to be chuted to car lot or home closer to love or farther and sooner to loss our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed every plural presence now some thing alone thanks to our singer man we wait for the train patient with hope a hope thats like complaint if i could tie a river around my loves waist like ribbon make sails out of her bloodand pin down death like a squirming bug if i could lift and rock each coffin in my arms i would start with hers now that you too must shortly go the way which in these bloodshot years uncounted men have gone in vanishing armies day by day and in their numbers will not come again i must not strain the moments of our meeting striving for each look each accent not to miss or question of our parting and our greeting is this the last of all is this or this last sight of all it may be with these eyes last touch last hearing since eyes hands and ears even serving love are our mortalities and cling to what they own in mortal fears but oh let end what will i hold you fast by immortal love which has no first or last i though i sing high and chaunt above her praising my girl it were not right to reckon her the poorer lover she does not love me less for her royal jewelled speechlessness she is the sapphire she the light the music in the pearl ii not from pert birds we learn the spring tide from open sky what speaks to us closer than far distances that hide in woods what is more dear than a cherry bough bees feeding near in the soft proffered blooms lo i am fed and honoured thus iii she has the stars own pulse its throbbing is a quick light she is a dove my soul draws to its breast her sobbing is for the warm dark there in the heat of her wings i would not care my close housed bird should take her flight to magnify our love go and catch a falling star get with child a mandrake root tell me where all past years are or who cleft the devils foot teach me to hear mermaids singing or to keep off envys stinging and find what wind serves to advance an honest mind if thou best born to strange sights things invisible to see ride ten thousand days and nights till age snow white hairs on thee thou when thou returnst wilt tell me all strange wonders that befell thee and swear no where lives a woman true and fair if thou findst one let me know such a pilgrimage were sweet yet do not i would not go though at next door we might meet though she were true when you met her and last till you write your letter yet she will be false ere i come to two or three poetry out loud note in the print anthology this poem is titled simply song the student may give either title during the recitation a thing as delicious as turning the last sound i heard into a word it cannot be or calling your hidden wish out into the broad space of the public to make you touch me instead of asking that i go naked a thing as delicious as any of that would not be as safe as a dumb silence i am resting my back with a cushion against the chair sitting inside the ache when i soaked myself in a balm the way women went to the river and held things down until they were as wet as jesus hanging in the rain his pain the invocation of roars destroying the temple the things i know are not the things you wish to know or they are and i cannot give them to you until i see what you think of contracts of what binds the mornings to unkind sunlight what takes a hawk and lets it know there are things less grand than flying things that crave there is a music to this sadness in a room somewhere two people dance i do not mean to say desire is everything a cup half empty is simply half a cup how many times have we been there and not there i have seen waitresses slip a nights worth of tips into the jukebox their eyes saying yes to nothing in particular desire is not the point tonight your name is a small thing falling through sadness we wake alone in houses of sticks of straw of wind how long have we stood at the end of the pier watching that water going in the distance the lights curve along tampa bay a wishbone ready to snap and the night riding on that half promise a half moon to light the whole damned sky this is the way things are with us sometimes we love almost enough we say i can do this i can do more than this and faith feeds on its own version of the facts in the end the heart turns on itself like hunger to a spoon we make a wish in a vanishing landscape sadness is one more reference point like music in the distance two people rise from a kitchen table as if to dance what do they know about love or will we be lost forever in the silence of the last breath not taken the blue sweep of your arm like a dancer clowning in wrinkled pajamas across the sky the abrupt brief zigzag of a jay all night the whiteness and all day once we have been lifted up into empty morning like ice in the darkness of these white fields neither the ghost tracks of skis nor steel skates will wake us where are we looking for each other separated on the opposite hillside i see you miles away from me a dot of faint color reddening small bruised warmth opening its cranberry mouth and saying what are you saying under a cold blanket an immense loneliness stretches in every direction with no fences a few sticks tweak the crusted snow thin remnants of an army of lost soldiers i see footsteps ahead of me but whose and where will they lead me parallel or converging is it not possible there will be one jet trail that will not vanish two phantom ribbons unfolding that will not feather themselves away wrapped in our white parkas in what shifting laminations snowflakes that mean nothing transparent eyes spitting what glacier will we choose to lie on in what igloo rest barely breathing in an air pocket just below the surface rustling beneath blizzards where is your foot most beautiful with blue toenails i will be looking for it always wherever it is next to me in the darkness of rumpled white sheets pale siftings clouds sudden scarves of ourselves gusting loose sandpapery as snow lifting in what chill citadel of ice crystals will i find you montana you beat your fists against museum doors your bronze dress shimmering in the starless night the doors are locked montana dreaming of snow white mice cluttering the shelves in your kitchen snow white mice inside the oven snow white mice clogging your shiny aluminum sink their corpses curled up like piles of fluffy cotton mosques are desecrated and altars overturned outside the museums cool stone walls border skirmishes seen and heard in the distance delicate bursts of poppy red flames the wars go on and on invading your dreams the mirror reflects a young mans body dangling from a rope and you gasp o my brother the doctor finally lets you in unlocking the door forbidden to touch you he stares straight ahead avoiding your curious glance youre partly egyptian arent you the doctor inquires you stalk the dark museum halls calling out the name of your dead lover the name of a man unspoken since the siege of troy how did you guess you growl do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with the doctor smiles averting his gaze from your ravaged face he longs to trace your fish scale dress with his slender fingers montana scarlet shameless montana you stalk the dark museum halls in a rage ripping your satin gloves to shreds you pry open coffins reading between the lines you decipher hieroglyphics on tombs any message would do you say tiny jeweled tears permanently etched in the corners of your eyes the doctor sighs his impotence ancient as the curse that immortalizes him the terrible secret that pursues you montana on the night of a full moon you are a perfumed woman in a bronze dress who shatters glass with a vengeance searching in vain for signs and clues among the rubies and emeralds that litter museum floors the museum works for science not for loot the doctor tells you you laugh at his bandaged face the sad smoldering eyes the only things visible beneath the gauze you cant tell the blood from the paint splashed on these walls you say with contempt reaching out for his arm in spite of yourself he moves away i dislike being touched he whispers pardon me its an eastern prejudice you never see his anguish he wont allow it his pride is what keeps him going exhausted you lie amid the rubble the mummy guards your body and you dream of straddling your sleeping lovers back like a dolphin you ride underwater safe within the confines of deserted museum halls eight stars make a soft solfege above this motel where there are never stars i let a skinny man put his long thick dick in me for you so we could break our hearts the way you want me to somewhere a white wall stretches up behind the backs of a tribe whose obscurity protects its secret from the common world and the connivances it ordains what time is it what season is it i dont know the moon blows green gas into my skull i want to hide what i dream in a big boot and wear the boot and starve as i lean upon the boot of my destitution and drag the truth as a gimp would drag the weight of her body that would give me a feeling of honesty i wait for my shadow to forget me to take that one phantom step that i keep from taking i wait for the simple flash of a dancers spat upon this one moon of stage light the minds lonely oval illuminated on the surface of some windless pond or slew and the old soft shoe practices to get it right husha husha hush in its constant audition of sawdust even this choreography of useless wishing is not enough to keep tonight from becoming nothing more than some floors forgotten routine where faded numbered dance steps silently waltz themselves away the orchestras now ready to faur into the evenings last song while i try to convince myself to cross this room for the first time all night and rinse whats left in some d butantes silver sequined waterfall hope keeling hopelessly ever closer to the edge across the floor other couples sashay on a tin flask empties itself from asking the shadows last chance now wasted in some chandeliers dim lust i didnt fall in love i fell through it came out the other side moments later hands full of matter waking up from the dream of a bullet tearing through the middle of my body i no longer understand anything for longer than a long moment or the time it takes to receive the shot this kind of gravity is like falling through a cloud forgetting it all and then being told about it later on the day you fell through a cloud it must be true if it were not then when did these strands of silver netting attach to my hair the problem was finding that you were real and not just a dream of clouds if you werent real i would address this letter to one of two entities myself or everyone else the effect would be equivalent the act of falling happens in time that is it takes long enough for the falling to shear away from the moments before and the moments after long enough for one to have thought i am falling i have been falling i continue to fall falling through a ring in this case would not mean falling through the center of the annulus a planet floats there falling through the ring means falling through the spaces between the objects that together make the ring on the way through clasp your fists around the universe nothing but ice gravel but open your hands when you reach the other side quickly before it melts what did i leave you trees in the old days used to stand and shape a shady lane where lovers wandered hand in hand who came from carentan this was the shining green canal where we came two by two walking at combat interval such trees we never knew the day was early june the ground was soft and bright with dew far away the guns did sound but here the sky was blue the sky was blue but there a smoke hung still above the sea where the ships together spoke to towns we could not see could you have seen us through a glass you would have said a walk of farmers out to turn the grass each with his own hay fork the watchers in their leopard suits waited till it was time and aimed between the belt and boot and let the barrel climb i must lie down at once there is a hammer at my knee and call it death or cowardice dont count again on me everythings all right mother everyone gets the same at one time or another its all in the game i never strolled nor ever shall down such a leafy lane i never drank in a canal nor ever shall again there is a whistling in the leaves and it is not the wind the twigs are falling from the knives that cut men to the ground tell me master sergeant the way to turn and shoot but the sergeants silent that taught me how to do it o captain show us quickly our place upon the map but the captains sickly and taking a long nap lieutenant whats my duty my place in the platoon he toos a sleeping beauty charmed by that strange tune carentan o carentan before we met with you we never yet had lost a man or known what death could do love meet me in the green glen beside the tall elm tree where the sweetbriar smells so sweet agen there come with me meet me in the green glen meet me at the sunset down in the green glen where weve often met by hawthorn tree and foxes den meet me in the green glen meet me in the green glen by sweetbriar bushes there meet me by your own sen where the wild thyme blossoms fair meet me in the green glen meet me by the sweetbriar by the mole hill swelling there when the west glows like a fire gods crimson bed is there meet me in the green glen you can tell by how he lists to let her kiss him that the getting as he gets it is good its good in the sweetly salty deeply thirsty way that a sea fogged rain is good after a summer long bout of inland drought and you know it when you see it dont you how it drenches whats dry how the having of it quenches there is a grassy inlet where your ocean meets your land a slip that needs a certain kind of vessel and when that shapely skiff skims in at last trimmed bright mast lightly flagging left and right then the long lush reeds of your longing part and soft against the hull of that bent wood almost im perceptibly brushes a luscious hush the heart heeds helplessly the hush of the very good multiplying in a column m by f do we get one or two as a result may the body stay glued to the soul may the soul fear the body do i ask too much i only wish the crucible of tenderness would meltmemories and i would sleep my cheekpressed against your back as on a motorbike mistress adrienne i have been given a bed with a pink dresser in the hothouse joining the concord public library the walls and roof are glass and my privacy comes from the apple geraniums violets ferns marigolds and white mayflags i get my meals with the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine to use i scour sweep and dust i hope you dont think of me as a runaway i remember your kindness your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza my journey was unusual i saw some of the war and it was terrible even far up into the north my first fright was at a train depot outside memphis where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened quinces and grapes they took me prisoner first i helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox of the locomotive then i was shown to a gentleman in the passenger car who was searching for his runaway negress in a purple dress he wouldnt identify me and i was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into an open boxcar and soon we were moving next to me a man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl maybe twelve years of age across from them a sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end by afternoon she was dead her two friends just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket the girl next to me whimpered and shook those quinces just ran straight through me and all i could do was squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia waters and hay we were given that night confederate uniforms to mend and when the others slept i dressed in three shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train the padding helped some but i couldnt walk the next day i hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock of turkeys some young hens and a corncrib with tall split palings the next morning from a hill i watched field workers on a tobacco plantation it took two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from a battle scene that night i found a horse with a bit in its mouth made of telegraph wire he carried me up all the way to youngstown chloe you must learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel i am grateful i had to swim two rivers i fished some for perch bream and trout and ate dried berries i stole a bushel of oysters from the porch of a farmhouse i treated my sores with blackgum from poplars i witnessed the hanging of three confederate soldiers at a trestle once they were done dancing they settled in their greatcoats like dead folded birds i have a hatred of men and i walked away from the trestle singing i spoke to the concord literary club last tuesday about my experiences i told them you never did abuse me how we would sit out in the gazebo and listen to the boys with their violins tambourines bones drums and sticks how we wept as girls when the fox bit the head off our peahen and that from that day how the peacock missing his mate would see her in his reflection in a downstairs window and fly at it increasing his iridescence with lacerations when i left you the windows were all missing and daubers were making their mud houses in the high corners of the hallway with sugar water and crepe i have put a new hem on my purple dress at night i walk down the aisles of the library the books climb twenty feet above me i just walk there naked with my tiny lamp i have the need to fling the lamp sometimes but i resist it mistress adrienne i saw three big cities burning did you know ladies from philadelphia rode for two days in wagons to climb a hill where with spyglasses they watched the war like a horse pulling contest at a fair the man beside me on the train who was sucking the little girls breasts he was your stable boy napoleon he said he never had a bad word for you his little mistress was still bare to the waist and before i leapt from the train and while he slept i ran a rod into his eye i stabbed him in his brain she stopped weeping remember that french lullaby where two fleas in a gentlemans mustache die like a kiss between the lips of the gentleman and his mistress how we laughed at it i hope you were not long unconscious there beside the pond i just ran away from you listening the whole night for your fathers hounds i am afraid i split your parasol on your skull if i dont hear from you i will try to understand chloe my love looks like a girl to night but she is old the plaits that lie along her pillow are not gold but threaded with filigree silver and uncanny cold she looks like a young maiden since her brow is smooth and fair her cheeks are very smooth her eyes are closed she sleeps a rare still winsome sleep so still and so composed nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her dreams of perfect things she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream and her dead mouth sings by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings the most beautiful bodies are like transparent glass they are bodies of the selfless or of those newlydead what appears transparent is really flameburning so brightly it appears like glass whatyoure looking through is the act of giving onething in life needed desperately given to another or perhaps life itself the most beautiful bodiesare not transparent but sometimes the colorof lead like the elephant whom a child with somepeanuts lifts by the trunk in his hand in the swirlingdust so that it appears he has lifted a monumentor a city with all its pain the bodies that seemtransparent are made of an ice so pure it appearsto be glass sweating where you desiring another glimpse your own face that weighs nothing and is burning lonely as four cherries on a tree at night new moon wet roads a moth or a snowflake whipping past glass lonely as the red noses of four clowns thrust up through snow their shine four whitened panes drawn from imagined memory lonely as no other lives touching to recorded water all objects stare their memories aware lonely as pain recoiling from itself imagining the cherries and roses reaching out four lanes over a plump helium heart slipped maybe from some kids wrist or a rushed lovers empty front seat through a half cracked car window rises like a shiny purple cloudlet toward todays gray mess of clouds trailing its gold ribbon like lightning that will never strike anything or anyone here on the forsaken ground its bold love increasingly illegible as it ascends over the frozen oaks riding swift currents toward the horizon a swollen word wobbling out of sight the palm tree exposesa large numberof loose carved spinesout of pleasure boredom to start overin the carved momentis to take cover a solid short womanin a pink wool suitproceeds anxiously doggedly aloneup a sidewalklaid down for her we dont believe it there are two kindsof choices pirate sources say unconscious and desperate if you refuse me once and think again i will complain you are deceivd love is no work of art it must be got and born not made and worn by every one that hath a heart or do you think they more than once can die whom you deny who tell you of a thousand deaths a day like the old poets feign and tell the pain they met but in the common way or do you think t too soon to yield and quit the field nor is that right they yield that first entreat once one may crave for love but more would prove this heart too little that too great oh that i were all soul that i might prove for you as fit a love as you are for an angel for i know none but pure spirits are fit loves for you you are all ethereal theres in you no dross nor any part thats gross your coarsest part is like a curious lawn the vestal relics for a covering drawn your other parts part of the purest fire that eer heavn did inspire makes every thought that is refind by it a quintessence of goodness and of wit thus have your raptures reachd to that degree in loves philosophy that you can figure to yourself a fire void of all heat a love without desire nor in divinity do you go less you think and you profess that souls may have a plenitude of joy although their bodies meet not to employ but i must needs confess i do not find the motions of my mind so purified as yet but at the best my body claims in them an interest i hold that perfect joy makes all our parts as joyful as our hearts our senses tell us if we please not them our love is but a dotage or a dream how shall we then agree you may descend but will not to my end i fain would tune my fancy to your key but cannot reach to that obstructed way there rests but this that whilst we sorrow here our bodies may draw near and when no more their joys they can extend then let our souls begin where they did end when our two souls stand up erect and strong face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher until the lengthening wings break into fire at either curv d point what bitter wrong can the earth do to us that we should not long be here contented think in mounting higher the angels would press on us and aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song into our deep dear silence let us stay rather on earth belov d where the unfit contrarious moods of men recoil away and isolate pure spirits and permit a place to stand and love in for a day with darkness and the death hour rounding it your name is a bird in my hand a piece of ice on my tongue the lips quick opening your name four letters a ball caught in flight a silver bell in my mouth a stone thrown into a silent lakeis the sound of your name the light click of hooves at night your name your name at my temple sharp click of a cocked gun your name impossible kiss on my eyes the chill of closed eyelids your name a kiss of snow blue gulp of icy spring water with your name sleep deepens april give all to love obey thy heart friends kindred days estate good fame plans credit and the muse nothing refuse t is a brave master let it have scope follow it utterly hope beyond hope high and more high it dives into noon with wing unspent untold intent but it is a god knows its own path and the outlets of the sky it was never for the mean it requireth courage stout souls above doubt valor unbending it will reward they shall return more than they were and ever ascending leave all for love yet hear me yet one word more thy heart behoved one pulse more of firm endeavor keep thee to day to morrow forever free as an arab of thy beloved cling with life to the maid but when the surprise first vague shadow of surmise flits across her bosom young of a joy apart from thee free be she fancy free nor thou detain her vestures hem nor the palest rose she flung from her summer diadem though thou loved her as thyself as a self of purer clay though her parting dims the day stealing grace from all alive heartily know when half gods go the gods arrive o love that stronger art than wine pleasing delusion witchery divine wont to be prized above all wealth disease that has more joys than health though we blaspheme thee in our pain and of thy tyranny complain we are all bettered by they reign what reason never can bestow we to this useful passion owe love wakes the dull from sluggish ease and learns a clown the art to please humbles the vain kindles the cold makes misers free and cowards bold tis he reforms the sot from drink and teaches airy fops to think when full brute appetite is fed and choked the glutton lies and dead thou new spirits dost dispense and finest the gross delights of sense virtues unconquerable aid that against nature can persuade and makes a roving mind retire within the bounds of just desire cheerer of age youths kind unrest and half the heaven of the blest in the ocean one fish swallows the other a geometric progression of loss you are bigger than i the calamity of love swelling out larger than us and what destiny partakes of our dilemma swallows the cause and effect eyes and kissing mouths and enlarged parts wanting to breathe and wanting there is no gentle sense to this is there only a kind of terror at the chain of events the scale of loss the ordered destruction one against the other all that something larger awaits its moment indigenous elvis works security chief joseph hair blue black and pomped turquoise and shell dangling from one ear silver chunks of rings on every bronze knuckle indigenous elvis works security x ray glances at your backpacks laptops empty still moist shoes indigenous elvis waves me to his

sweetheart doing your sister the one that got away i that have been a lover and could show it though not in these in rithmes not wholly dumb since i exscribe your sonnets am become a better lover and much better poet nor is my muse or i ashamed to owe it to those true numerous graces whereof some but charm the senses others overcome both brains and hearts and mine now best do know it for in your verse all cupids armory his flames his shafts his quiver and his bow his very eyes are yours to overthrow but then his mothers sweets you so apply her joys her smiles her loves as readers take for venus ceston every line you make know this i live beast days i am a water hour at night my eyelids droop like forest and sky my love knows few words i like it in your blood an urban image from the eighties when we hung out at chez madam arthur and at the back of the room women wrapped their arms around nights of ink and dawn calendar of murmurs vague caresses about the planet and its water we could have confused words but there were doors open confetti in the midst of darkness gentle ways to swoon in a corner with she who put her tongue in my mouth focus on yes on the womans eyelids caress not silence not word focus beyond hold me back just then encountering my ruddy face in the grand pianos cold black craquelure it conjured the jack o lantern moon dipping up over the roofs of the tenderloin only when i have done with the myths the inner spill that triggers us to flame breasts so sensitive a moments touch will call down fever the dark sea lane between limbic squall and the hearts harbour will i picture you just beyond innocence lying stripped by a thrown wide window letting the cool breeze covet your ardour chorus ca the yowes to the knowes ca them where the heather grows ca them where the burnie rows my bonie dearie hark the mavis evening sang sounding cludens woods amang then a fauldin let us gang my bonie dearie well gae down by cluden side thro the hazels spreading wide oer the waves that sweetly glide to the moon sae clearly yonder cludens silent towers where at moonshine midnight hours oer the dewy bending flowers fairies dance sae cheery ghaist nor bogle shalt thou fear thou rt to love and heaven sae dear nocht of ill may come thee near my bonie dearie fair and lovely as thou art thou hast stown my very heart i can die but canna part my bonie dearie julia i bring to thee this ring made for thy finger fit to show by this that our love is or should be like to it close though it be the joint is free so when loves yoke is on it must not gall or fret at all with hard oppression but it must play still either way and be too such a yoke as not too wide to overslide or be so strait to choke so we who bear this beam must rear ourselves to such a height as that the stay of either may create the burden light and as this round is nowhere found to flaw or else to sever so let our love as endless prove and pure as gold for ever right now im sipping a mango lassi in action town im not bereft at all in fact im pleasantly aware of people moving on all fours our voice and text messages will be erased in no time when i walk into stores they call me spark plug because i have a sparky manner things get all wavy from their constant attention its going to be okay im a good habit you dont need to trick me im not sure where i should put my hands when i walk down the street with you its funny to think about who i would call if something really awful happened id be jumping up and down not knowing who to call my way of doing things is scary even to me remember the toothbrush the honey bear and the meal that we thought would never end im counting on you to come through high water to come through chaos and to action town where well lift our aces to skyward aviation my pensive sara thy soft cheek reclined thus on mine arm most soothing sweet it is to sit beside our cot our cot oergrown with white flowered jasmin and the broad leaved myrtle meet emblems they of innocence and love and watch the clouds that late were rich with light slow saddening round and mark the star of eve serenely brilliant such would wisdom be shine opposite how exquisite the scents snatched from yon bean field and the world so hushed the stilly murmur of the distant sea tells us of silence and that simplest lute placed length ways in the clasping casement hark how by the desultory breeze caressed like some coy maid half yielding to her lover it pours such sweet upbraiding as must needs tempt to repeat the wrong and now its strings boldlier swept the long sequacious notes over delicious surges sink and rise such a soft floating witchery of sound as twilight elfins make when they at eve voyage on gentle gales from fairy land where melodies round honey dropping flowers footless and wild like birds of paradise nor pause nor perch hovering on untamed wing o the one life within us and abroad which meets all motion and becomes its soul a light in sound a sound like power in light rhythm in all thought and joyance everywhere methinks it should have been impossible not to love all things in a world so filled where the breeze warbles and the mute still air is music slumbering on her instrument and thus my love as on the midway slope of yonder hill i stretch my limbs at noon whilst through my half closed eyelids i behold the sunbeams dance like diamonds on the main and tranquil muse upon tranquility full many a thought uncalled and undetained and many idle flitting phantasies traverse my indolent and passive brain as wild and various as the random gales that swell and flutter on this subject lute and what if all of animated nature be but organic harps diversely framed that tremble into thought as oer them sweeps plastic and vast one intellectual breeze at once the soul of each and god of all but thy more serious eye a mild reproof darts o beloved woman nor such thoughts dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject and biddest me walk humbly with my god meek daughter in the family of christ well hast thou said and holily dispraised these shapings of the unregenerate mind bubbles that glitter as they rise and break on vain philosophys aye babbling spring for never guiltless may i speak of him the incomprehensible save when with awe i praise him and with faith that inly feels who with his saving mercies heal d me a sinful and most miserable man wildered and dark and gave me to possess peace and this cot and thee heart honored maid shiraishi called upon the great sky cock wanted an explanation wondered whythe echo of form without the wisdom why the bent wit without the timing wondered as i have how a man bareupon the bed may rise as if in praisebut fail to be grateful for the gift at hand o dick of questionable devise o schlong of longing as presentbut ultimately unknowable as yourmaker i would worship at the fountif i had more faith if i knew yourweeping eye was on me alone i to the fatesthey cannot keep the peaceor their hands off each other breed not yet preach the old discredited creed love is charity conceived as a coin dropped in a beggars cup reason not the need gluttony is no nicer than greedor wrath but lustis our categorical must we have no choice but to breed ii olympiaolympia lies on her couchwith an insolent stare her hand hiding her crotch a flower in her hair she splits the lot of us with a sneer we are either breeders or queer we will fight wars because of her she will root us on we will win the face in the mirror is not brave but we crave contact with her skinand the jewel in the mouth of her cave she tempts like a sinand under her spell we fallinto a deep enchanted sleep and wake up ready to make the leap ready to heed her call only now were alone on streets less friendly than wilderness a platoon of ex pals in manhattan olympia tempts like a sin but then sends us home to the wife commands us to resume the lifewe had planned to give up in her honor the life of a dutiful husband a modest successin his profession impressive in credentials in mood depressive but nothing that a pill wont cure you ask if he is happy sure and olympia lies on her couch with her insolent stare her hand hiding her crotch a flower in her hair she turned to gold and fell in love she danced life upside down she opened her wild eyes again and asked some strangers in the strangers felt her in and out they found her outsides thin since her heart was still and hard they knocked her insides in as he spoke we could hear ever more loudly the noise of the burning fires the flood of flames was coming nearer and nearer my father let me take you upon my shoulders and carry you with me the burden will be easy whatever happens you and i will experience it together peril or safety whichever it will be little i lus will come along beside me my wife will follow behind us and you my servants listen to what i say just as you leave the limits of the city there is a mound and the vestiges of a deserted temple of ceres and a cypress tree that has been preserved alive for many years by the piety of our fathers we will all meet there though perhaps by different ways and father you must carry in your arms the holy images of our household gods i coming so late from the fighting and the carnage cannot presume to touch them until i have washed myself in running water thus i spoke i take up the tawny pelt of a lion and cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it and bowing down i accept the weight of my father i lus puts his hand in mine and goes along beside me trying to match my steps as best he can trying his best to keep up my wife follows behind us a little way back so we all set out together making our way among the shadows and i who only just a little while ago had faced undaunted showers of arrows and swarms of enemy greeks am frightened by every slightest change in the air and startled by every slightest sound i hear fearful for whom i walk with and whom i carry and just as i had almost come to the gates and thought that i had almost gotten us free i thought i heard the sound of many feet and my father peering intently into the shadows cries out to me get away get away my son my son they are coming i see their shining shields i see the glow of their weapons in the dark i am alarmed and i dont know what happened but some power hostile to me distracts my wits and i am confused and i lead us away by ways that i dont know and off the familiar streets that together we are following and so o god some fate has taken away my wife cre sa my wife away from me what happened did she wander from the way that we were going did she fall back having to rest some place back there and so we left her i did not know i never saw her again and as we went i never turned to look behind and never thought of her until we reached the mound and ceres ancient place when all of us at last had gotten there we all were there but she had vanished and she wasnt there gone from her people gone from her child and her husband what men or gods in my frenzy did i not cry out against what worse sight had i seen i left ascanius and anchises and the household gods in the care of my companions and i found a secluded place deep in a valley for them to hide and i myself took up my shining weapons and sought the city again determined no matter what to look for my cre sa everywhere in troy i find my way along the walls and to and through the shadowed gate id left the city by carefully step by unseen step in the dark backwards the way i came i make my way everywhere as i go fills me with terror the very silence around me fills me with terror i make my way to my home in case in case shes gone back there the greeks had invaded the house and set it on fire and through the house the fire rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof and the flames tower high above the burning house and the heat of the burning pours up into the sky and so i go on and once again i see the palace of priam and the citadel and in the empty courtyard of junos shrine theres phoenix and dire ulysses guarding the treasures taken from everywhere from the shrines that the greeks had set fire to the golden bowls the holy altar tables the stolen holy vestments boys and trembling matrons stand around i wander in the streets in my desperation calling out her name cre sa cre sa calling cre sa over and over again and as i went among the ruined buildings and through the streets of the ruined city lo suddenly there rose before my eyes the strangely magnified image of my wife i was stupefied my hair stood on end my voice got caught in my throat then she spoke to me and said words that altered everything for me beloved husband what use is it for you to persist in this insanity of grief what has happened here has happened not without the will of the gods the high lord of olympus does not permit cre sa to go with you to be with you on your journey where you are going long exile will be yours ploughing across vast seas until you come to hesperia where lydian tiber gently flows between rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy a king and wedded to a royal wife give up your weeping now for your cre sa i a dardan woman and the spouse of divine venuss son will never see the scornful households of the myrmidons or the dolopians and never have to be a scullion slave in service to some greek matron the mighty mother keeps me on these shores farewell and may your care protect and cherish your child and mine and having spoken thus the image of her receded into air leaving me weeping with so much still to say three times i tried to embrace her and to hold her three times the image clasped in vain escaped as if it were a breeze or on the wings of a vanishing dream and so the night being over i returned to my companions where they were when i got there i was amazed to see how many others women and men had come wretched survivors of the fall of the city to join us in the exile and the journey a heartbreaking company come from everywhere ready in their hearts and with their fortunes to follow me wherever i was going and now the morning star was rising over the highest ridges of ida bringing in the day that was beginning the danaans held the city behind the gates that they had locked there was no hope of further help and so i acknowledged this and taking up the burden of my father once again i sought the hills if my own voice falters tell them hubris was my way of adoring you the hollow of the hulk of you so feverish in life cut open reveals ten thousand rags of music in your thoracic cavity the hands are received bagged and examination reveals no injury winter then the body is cold to the touch unplunderable kept in its drawer of old world harrowing teeth in fair repair will you be buried where nowhere your mouth a globe of gauze and glossolalia and opening most delft of blue your heart was a mess a mob of hoofprints where the skittish colts first learned to stand catching on to their agility a shock of freedom wild maned the eyes have hazel irides and the conjunctivae are pale with hemorrhaging one lung smaller congested with rose smoke the other filled with a swarm of massive sentimentia i adore you more i know the wingspan of your voice whole gorgeous flock of harriers cannot be taken down you would like it now this snow this hour your visitation here tonight not altogether unexpected the night laborers immigrants all assemble here aching for to speaking longing for to work the hunter to the husbandmanpays tribute since our love began and to love loyalty dedicatesthe phantom kills he meditates let me embrace embracing you beauty of other shape and hue odd glinting graces of which noneshone more than candle to your sun your well kissed hand was beckoning mein unfamiliar imagery smile your forgiveness each bright ghostdives in loves glory and is lostyielding your comprehensive pridea homage even to suicide liebe meine liebe i had not hoped to be so poor the night winds reach like the blind breath of the world in a rhythm without mind gusting and beating as if to destroy us battering our poverty and all the lands flat and cold and dark under iron snow the dog leaps in the wind barking maddened with winter and his voice claps again and again down the valley like tatters of revolutionary pennants birches cry and hemlocks by the brook stand hunched and downcast with their hands in their pockets liebe the world is wild and without intention how far this might be from the night of christmas if it were not for you down the reaching wind shrieks of starlight bear broken messages among mountains where shadows plunge yet our brightness is unwavering kennst du das land wo die zitronen bl hn im dunkeln laub die goldorangen liebe art thou singing it is a question partly of the tree with our stars and partly of your radiance brought from the land where legends flower to this land but more than these our bright poverty is a house in the wind and a light on the mountain liebe our light rekindled in this remoteness from the other land in this dark of the blue mountain where only the winds gather is what we are for the time that we are what we know for the time that we know how gravely and sweetly the poor touch in the dark do i fuck you or hate you it feels wrong in every limbbut i do it anywaycause it feels right when youre in your generosity is perverseand confined to your bedthe only thing youve given me freelyis head white boots by rachel louise hodgson when he speaks of deserved and undeserved as more than terms how they can matter suddenly i can tell he believes it sometimes a thing can seem star like when its just a star stripped of whatever small form of joy likeness equals sometimes the thought that im doomed to fail that the body is keeps me almost steady if steadiness is what a gift for a while brings feathers burst at last pods of milkweed

oak park took two tours and looked at some of the houses i took the long way back along the lake the place that i came home to a cavernous apartment on the east side of milwaukee seems basically a part of that tradition with the same admixture of expansion and restraint the space takes off yet leaves behind a nagging feeling of confinement with the disconcerting sense that while the superficial conflicts got resolved the underlying tensions brought to equilibrium it isnt yet a place in which i feel that i can live imagine someone reading contemplate a man oblivious to his settings and then a distant person standing in an ordinary room hemmed in by limitations yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life that blooms within its own mysterious enclosure in a solitary space in which the soul can breathe and where the heart can stay not by discovering it but by creating it by giving it a self sustaining atmosphere of depth both in the architecture and in the unconstructed life that it contains in a late and very brief remark freud speculates that space is the projection of a psychic apparatus which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself and wright extols that primitive sense of shelter which can turn a house into a refuge from despair i wish that time could bring the future back again and let me see things as they used to seem to me before i found myself alone in an emancipated state alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow there used to be a logic in the way time passed that made it flow directly towards an underlying space where all the minor individual lives converged the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past and bathed the future in a soft familiar light i remembered from home and which has faded and the voices get supplanted by the rain the nights seem colder and the angel in the mind that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air while in its place a kind of monument appears magnificent in isolation compromised by proximity and standing in a small and singular expanse as though the years had been a pretext for reflection and my life had been a phase of disenchantment as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw the reassuring settings slowly melt away and what remains is just a sense of getting older in a variation of the parable the pure of heart descend into a kingdom that they never wanted and refused to see the homely notions of the good the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like adolescent fictions as the real forms of life deteriorate with manically increasing speed the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter and the serenity it brings not in reflection but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken of losing everything of acquiescing in the obvious approach the house shaped like a box the life that cant accommodate anothers as the heart shrinks down to tiny local things why cant the more expansive ecstasies come true i met you more than thirty years ago in in mrs wolfords eighth grade history class all moments weigh the same and matter equally yet those that time brings back create the fables of a happy or unsatisfying life of minutes passing on the way to either peace or disappointment like a paper calendar on which its always autumn and were back in school again or a hazy afternoon near the beginning of october with the world series playing quietly on the radio and the windows open and the california sunlight filling up the room when i survey the mural stretched across the years across my heart i notice mostly small neglected parts of no importance to the whole design but which in their obscurity seem more permanent and real i see the desks and auditorium suffused with yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that still remains there in a space pervaded by a soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate as though the future werent real and the present were amorphous with nothing to hold on to and the past were there forever and the art that time inflicts upon its subjects cant eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood which harden into shapes as it recedes i wish i knew a way of looking at the world that didnt find it wanting or of looking at my life that didnt always see a half completed structure made of years and filled with images and gestures emblematic of the past like gatsbys light or prousts imbalance on the stones i wish there were a place where i could stay and leave the world alone an enormous stadium where i could wander back and forth across a field replete with all the incidents and small details that gave the days their textures that bound the minutes into something solid and that linked them all together in a way that used to seem eternal we used to go to dances in my familys ancient cadillac which blew up late one summer evening climbing up the hill outside del mar and later i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles baby butcher album at your house in mission bay and three years later listening to the velvet underground performing in a roller skating rink years arent texts or anything like texts and yet i often think of that way as though that single year contained the rhythms of the rest as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in intractable confusion as the wedding turned into a puzzling fiasco over poor john godfreys hair the parts were real and yet the dense and living whole they once composed seems broken now its voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me more distantly each day until the tangled years are finally drained of feeling and collapse into a sequence of the places where we lived your parents house in kensington and mine above the canyon then the flat by sears in cambridge where we moved when we got married and the third floor of the house on francis avenue near harvard square the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the year that john was born and last of all the house in whitefish bay where you live now and all those years came inexplicably undone in mid july the sequence ended late last year suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world as it exists for one then half of mine has ended while the fragment which has recently come to be contains no vantage point from which to see it whole i think that people are the sum of their illusions that the cares that make them difficult to see are eased by distance with their errors blending in an intricate harmony their truths abiding in a subtle spark or psyche each incomparable yet each the same as all the others and their disparate careers all joined together in a tangled moral vision whose intense meandering design seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling as in grief or in the pathos of a life cut off by loneliness indifference or hate because the most important thing is human happiness not in the sense of private satisfactions but of lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real the whole transcends its tensions like the intimate reflections on the day that came at evening whose significance was usually overlooked or misunderstood because the facts were almost always unexceptional two years ago we took our son to paris last night i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show and then took him home i look at all the houses as i walk down hackett avenue to work i teach my classes visit friends cook introspective meals for myself yet in the end the minutes dont add up whats lost is the perception of the world as something good and held in common as a place to be perfected in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters that endowed it with integrity and structure and that merged its private moments with the past what broke it into pieces what transformed the flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and smoldering resentment like coming home too early or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob i wish that life could be a window on the sun instead of just this porch where i can stand and contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution the guggenheim museum just reopened tonight i watched a segment of the news on pbs narrated by a woman we met years ago at bobs that showed how most of wrights interior had been restored and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky i like the houses better they flow in all directions merging with the scenery and embodying a milder more domestic notion of perfection on a human scale that doesnt overwhelm the life that it encloses isnt there a way to feel at home within the confines of this bland accommodating structure made of souvenirs and emblems like the hammock hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished prairie school house in whitefish bay the lineal reduced descendant of the flameproof wright house just a block or two away from where i live now i usually walk along the street on sunday musing on how beautiful it seems how aspects of it recapitulate the oak park house and studio with open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior and with the entrance half concealed on the side a characteristic feature of his plans that made it difficult to find although the hope was that in trying to get inside the visitors eye would come to linger over subtleties he might have failed to see in much the way that in the course of getting older and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here i found myself pulled backwards through these old uncertain passages distracted by the details and meeting only barriers to understanding why the years unfolded as they did and why my life turned out the way it has like his signature pathway of discovery with each diversion adding to the integrity of the whole there is this sweep life has that makes the accidents of time and place seem small everything alters and the personal concerns that love could hold together for a little while decay and then the world seems strange again and meaningless and free i miss the primitive confusions and the secret way things came to me each evening and the pain i still wonder where the tears went standing in my room each day and quietly inhabiting a calm suspended state enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me with the background noise cascading out of nothing like a song that makes the days go by a song incorporating everything not into what it says but simply in the way it touches me a single image of dispersal the inexhaustible perception of contingency and transience and isolation it brings them back to me i have the inwardness i think i must have wanted and the quietude the solitary temper and this space where i can linger with the silence curling all around me like the sound of pure passage waiting here surrounded by the furniture the books and lists and all these other emblems of the floating world the prints of raindrops that begin as mist that fall discreetly through the atmosphere and disappear and then i feel them in the air in a reserved more earthly music filled with voices reassembling in a wellspring of remembrance talking to me again and finding shelter in the same evasive movements i can feel in my own life cloaked in a quiet dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old and fading out of other peoples consciousness and dying with its deepest insecurities and fears concealed by their own protective colorations as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home it has the texture of an uncreated substance hovering between the settings it had come to love and some unformulated state i cant imagine waiting for the telephone to ring obsessed with ways to occupy these wide unstructured hours and playing records by myself and waking up alone all things are disparate yet subject to the same intense eradicating wills of time and personality like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build between our lives and emptiness the certainty they seemed to have just two or three short years ago before the anger spread its poison over everything i think about the way our visions locked together in a nightmare play of nervousness and language living day to day inside the concentrated force of that relentless argument whose words swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety two people clinging to their versions of their lives almost like children living out each others intermittent fantasies that fed upon themselves as though infected by some vile concentrated hatred who then woke up and planned that evenings dinner its all memories now and distance miles away the cat is sleeping on the driveway johns in school and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen nothing really changes the external world intrudes and then withdraws and then becomes continuous again i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant lanterns made of opalescent art glass part i guess of what this mornings paper called the wright craze i like the easy way the days go by the parts of aging that have come to seem familiar and the uneventful calm that seems to settle on the house at night each morning brings the mirrors reassuring face as though the years had left the same enduring person simplified and changed no longer vaguely desperate no longer torn yet still impatient with himself and still restless but drained of intricacy and rage like a mild paradox uninteresting in its own right yet existing for the sake of something stranger now and then our life comes over me in brief involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom unexpectedly in fleeting moments of regret that come before the ache the pang that gathers sharply like an indrawn breath a strange and thoughtful kind of pain as though a steel band had somehow snapped inside my heart i dont know but what i do know is that none of it is ever going to come to me again why did i think a person only distantly like me might finally represent my life what aspects of my attitudes my cast of mind my inconclusive way of tossing questions at the world had i supposed might realize another persons fantasies and turn her into someone else who gradually became a separate part of me and argued with the very words i would have used and looked at me through eyes id looked at as though gazing at myself i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams or in these self reflexive reveries sustaining all the charms that contemplation holds until the long enchantment of the soul with what it sees is lifted and it startles at a space alight with objects of its infantile gaze like people in a mall i saw her just the other day i felt a kind of comfort at her face one tinctured with bemusement at the strange and guarded person shed become attractive vaguely friendly brisk too brisk but no one i could think might represent my life why did i even try to see myself in whats outside the strangeness pushes it away propels the vision back upon itself into these regions filled with shapes that i can wander through and never see as though their image were inherently unreal the houses on a street the quiet backyard shade the room restored to life with bric a brac i started by revisiting these things then slowly reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible that balanced sympathy and space inside an abstract edifice combining reaches of the past with all these speculations all this artful preening of the heart i sit here at my desk perplexed and puzzled teasing out a tangled skein of years we wove together and trying to combine the fragments of those years into a poem who cares if life if someones actual life is finally insignificant and small theres still a splendor in the way it flowers once and fades and leaves a carapace behind there isnt time to linger over why it happened or attempt to make its mystery come to life again and last like someone still embracing the confused perceptions of himself embedded in the past as though eternity lay there for heavens a delusion and eternity is in the details and this tiny insubstantial life is all there is and that would be enough but for the reoccurring dreams i often have of you sometimes at night the banished unrealities return as though a room suffused with light and poetry took shape around me pictures line the walls its early summer somewhere in remembrance of things past marcel reflecting on his years with albertine with x suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance of the separation of two lives in time and space i think the same estrangements mirrored in each life in how it seems both adequate and incomplete part day to day existence part imaginary construct beckoning at night and sighing through my dreams like some disconsolate chimera or the subject of a lonely terrifying sadness or the isolation of a quiet winter evening when the house feels empty and silence intervenes but in the wonderful enclosure opening in my heart i seem to recognize our voices lilting in the yard inflected by the rhythms of a song whose words are seamless and whose lines are never ending i can almost see the contours of your face and sense the presence of the trees and reimagine all of us together in a deep abiding happiness as if the three of us inhabited a fragile made up world that seemed to be so permanent so real i have this fantasy its early in the evening you and i are sitting in the backyard talking friends arrive then drinks and dinner conversation the lovely summer twilight lasts forever whats the use what purpose do these speculations serve what mild enchantments do these meditations leave theyre just the murmurs of an age of middle age that help to pass the time that they retrieve before subsiding leaving everything unchanged each of us at times has felt the future fade or seen the compass of his life diminished or realized some tangible illusion was unreal driving down to evanston last week i suddenly remembered driving down that road eight years ago so caught up in some story id just finished that id missed the way the countryside was changing how in place of trees there now were office towers and theme parks parts of a confusingly panoply of barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape filled with high receding clouds and rows of flimsy houses in what used to be a field i thought of other peoples lives and how impossible it seemed to grasp them on the model of my own as little mirrors of infinity or sense their forms of happiness or in their minor personal upheavals feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale and see its abstract argument made visible i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude how life lacks shape until its given one by love and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself and part of some incorporating whole that feels and has a face and lets it live forever all of these seemed true and cancelled one another leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence tracing out the contours of a world erased like music tracing out the contours of the mind for life has the form of a winding curve in space and in its wake the human figure disappears look at our surroundings where a previous age could visualize a landscape we see borders yet i think the underlying vision is the same a person positing a world that he can see and cant contain and vexed by other people everything is possible some of it seemed real or nearly real yet in the end it spoke to me alone in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager ledge above a waterfall or rolling across a vast expanding plain on which theres always room but only room for one it starts and ends inside an ordinary room while in the interim brimming with illusions filled with commonplace delights that make the days go by with simple arguments and fears and with the nervous inkling of some vague utopian conceit transforming both the landscape and our lives until we look around and find ourselves at home but in a wholly different world and even those catastrophes that seemed to alter everything seem fleeting grounded in a natural order all of us are subject to and ought to celebrate yet why that things are temporary doesnt render them unreal unworthy of regretting its not as though the past had never happened all those years were real and their loss was real and it is sad i dont know what else to call it im glad that both of us seem happy yet what troubles me is just the way what used to be a world turned out in retrospect to be a state of mind and no more tangible than that and now its gone and in its place i find the image of a process of inexorable decay or of some great unraveling that drags the houses forward into emptiness and backwards into pictures of the intervening days love pieced together out of nothing and im certain that this austere vision finally is true and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe it comes from much too high above the world and seems to me too hopeless too extreme but then i found myself one winter afternoon remembering a quiet morning in a classroom and inventing everything again in ordinary terms that seemed to comprehend a childish dream of love and then the loss of love and all the intricate years between i stoplights edged the licorice street with ribbon neon embroidering wet sidewalks she turned into the driveway and leaped in the dark a blackbird perched on the bouncing twig of a maple heard her whisper stranger lover the lost days are over while i walk from car to door something inward opens like four oclocks in rain earth cold from autumn pulls me i cant breathe the same with dirt for marrow and mist for skin blurring my vision my visions separate self i stand drunk in this glitter under the skys grey shelter the city maple not half so bitter hurls itself in two directions until both tips darken and disappear as i darken my reflection in the smoking mirror of my home how faint the sound of dry leaves like the clattering keys of another morning another world ii she looked out the window at some inward greying door the maple held her glance made ground fog from her cigarette beyond uneven stairs children screamed gunned each other down then she sealed her nimble dreams with water from a murky bay for him i map this galaxy of dust that turns without an answer when it rains i remember his face in the corridor of a past apartment and trace the anguish around his mouth his wrinkled forehead unguarded eyes the foreign fruit of an intricate sadness with the grace that remains i catch a glint around a door i cannot enter the clock echoes in dishtowels i search loves center and bang pans against the rubble of my day the lucid grandeur of wet ground the strangeness of a fatal sun that makes us mark on the margin of our loss trust in the gossamer of touch trust in the late plowed field iii when the sun opened clouds and walked into her mongrel soul she chopped celery into rocky remnants of the sea and heard fat sing up bread a better dying the magnet in each seed of the green pepper kept her flying floating toward memories that throb like clustered stars the dark water laughter of ducks a tangle of november oaks toward sudden music on a wheel of brilliant dust where like a moon she must leap back and forth from emptiness i remember the moon shimmering loss and discovery along a water edge and skirting a slice of carrot i welcome eternity in that sad eye of autumn rare and real i dance while vegetables sing in pairs i hug my death my chorus of years and search and stretch and leap for i will be apprentice to the blood in spite of the mood of a world that keeps rusting rusting the wild throats of birds iv in lamplight she saw the smoke of anothers dream her daughter walk woods where snow weighs down pine her son cry on a bridge that ends in deep rooted dark her man stalled on a lonely road realize his torque was alcohol and hatred hungry for silence i listen to wind to the sound of water running down mountain my own raw breath between the sounds a seaborn god plays his reed in the caverns of my being i wear his amethyst let go my dreams millars lacewings and junebugs scatter widen and batter the dark brightening this loud dust with the fever of their eyes oh crazy itch that grabs us beyond loss and lets us forgive so that we can answer birds and deer lightning and rain shadow and hurricane truth waits in the creek cutting the winter brown hills it sings with needles of ice sings because of its scar to him who in the love of nature holds communion with her visible forms she speaks a various language for his gayer hours she has a voice of gladness and a smile and eloquence of beauty and she glides into his darker musings with a mild and healing sympathy that steals away their sharpness ere he is aware when thoughts of the last bitter hour come like a blight over thy spirit and sad images of the stern agony and shroud and pall and breathless darkness and the narrow house make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart go forth under the open sky and list to natures teachings while from all around earth and her waters and the depths of air comes a still voice yet a few days and thee the all beholding sun shall see no more in all his course nor yet in the cold ground where thy pale form was laid with many tears nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist thy image earth that nourished thee shall claim thy growth to be resolved to earth again and lost each human trace surrendering up thine individual being shalt thou go to mix for ever with the elements to be a brother to the insensible rock and to the sluggish clod which the rude swain turns with his share and treads upon the oak shall send his roots abroad and pierce thy mould yet not to thine eternal resting place shalt thou retire alone nor couldst thou wish couch more magnificent thou shalt lie down with patriarchs of the infant world with kings the powerful of the earth the wise the good fair forms and hoary seers of ages past all in one mighty sepulchre the hills rock ribbed and ancient as the sun the vales stretching in pensive quietness between the venerable woods rivers that move in majesty and the complaining brooks that make the meadows green and poured round all old oceans gray and melancholy waste are but the solemn decorations all of the great tomb of man the golden sun the planets all the infinite host of heaven are shining on the sad abodes of death through the still lapse of ages all that tread the globe are but a handful to the tribes that slumber in its bosom take the wings of morning pierce the barcan wilderness or lose thyself in the continuous woods where rolls the oregon and hears no sound save his own dashings yet the dead are there and millions in those solitudes since first the flight of years began have laid them down in their last sleep the dead reign there alone so shalt thou rest and what if thou withdraw in silence from the living and no friend take note of thy departure all that breathe will share thy destiny the gay will laugh when thou art gone the solemn brood of care plod on and each one as before will chase his favorite phantom yet all these shall leave their mirth and their employments and shall come and make their bed with thee as the long train of ages glide away the sons of men the youth in lifes green spring and he who goes in the full strength of years matron and maid the speechless babe and the gray headed man shall one by one be gathered to thy side by those who in their turn shall follow them so live that when thy summons comes to join the innumerable caravan which moves to that mysterious realm where each shall take his chamber in the silent halls of death thou go not like the quarry slave at night scourged to his dungeon but sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust approach thy grave like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams when my lover became my enemy i made my bed amongst winds and drove the old road till my heart crashed wheres the bypass washing my shirts wringing them out hung in the breeze

cleanse our vision the fish were silver and scarlet and green and the color of sea the fish were lovelier than even the sea with its silvery scales we thought of return lovely too the women with jars on their heads olive brown clay shaped softly like thighs we each thought of our women their voices their laughs the way they walked down the street and each of us laughed and it rained on the sea in vineyards that cling to cracks in the earth water softens the leaves and the grape stems the sky is colored by occasional clouds that redden with pleasure and sun on earth flavors and smells in the sky color and we were alone there we thought of return the way a man thinks of morning after an utterly sleepless night we took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten of fruit all so alive in

stairs and into my fathers waiting blue car how to explain this to my dates whisper why we could not finish this dance its not like the pig had any special powers or could take a tiny bite from my leg only assurances that it was simply scandal to be followed home when my date and i pull into my driveway and dim the lights we take care to make all the small noises that get made in times like these even smaller squeaks in the seats a slow spin of the radio dial the silver click of my belt too late a single black hair flickers awake the ear of the dark animal waiting for me at the end of the walk my fumbling of keys and various straps a wild dance to the door the pig grunting in tune to each hurried step each of his wet breaths puffing into tiny clouds a small storm brewing even at my favorite coffeeshop downtown redford is a hard man to feed this morning he picks at his grilled asiago mastercrust with a slow disdainful frown could they spare the fromage on this so called treat he takes a sip of hazelnut coffee then winces delicately into the neck of his sweater vest i bite powerfully through my cinnamon frenchroll well if you really dont think you got enough fromage you should just go back up there tell the girl i start on redfords coffee while he looks glumly at the metal napkin dispenser just then the electric chime above the door sounds a man sweeps in rests his guitar case on one of the slim caf chairs his dark hair is arranged in a series of perpetually break wavefronts a small muscle jumps in his jaw as he orders a cinnamon frenchroll toasted with cream cheese i lean foward jabbing redford with my plastic coffee wand check out that guy over there i say intense redford shrugs i think hes irish i say watching the man bite into his bagel the instrument case hovers on the chair edge he could have a guitar in there or else a sword from the crusades i press my tongue into the square shaped hole in the lid of my coffee cup listen redford says if were going to be together you have to take this he pushes a small velvet box across the table what are you doing i ask but redford doesnt answer he just looks down at the table one hand pressed to each of his temples in the box is a square of chocolate like the top of a signet ring smooth but edged in something bright its smoked salt from wales redford says handmade in limited quantities i turn the little box in my hands the salt sparkles like an arctic church i have to blink against it all fortune hath taken thee away my love my lifes soul and my souls heaven above fortune hath taken thee away my princess my only light and my true fancys mistress fortune hath taken all away from me fortune hath taken all by taking thee dead to all joy i only live to woe so fortune now becomes my mortal foe in vain you eyes you eyes do waste your tears in vain you sighs do smoke forth my despairs in vain you search the earth and heaven above in vain you search for fortune rules in love thus now i leave my love in fortunes hands thus now i leave my love in fortunes bands and only love the sorrows due to me sorrow henceforth it shall my princess be i joy in this that fortune conquers kings fortune that rules on earth and earthly things hath taken my love in spite of cupids might so blind a dame did never cupid right with wisdoms eyes had but blind cupid seen then had my love my love for ever been but love farewell though fortune conquer thee no fortune base shall ever alter me can life be a blessing or worth the possessing can life be a blessing if love were away ah no though our love all night keep us waking and though he torment us with cares all the day yet he sweetens he sweetens our pains in the taking theres an hour at the last theres an hour to repay in evry possessing the ravishing blessing in evry possessing the fruit of our pain poor lovers forget long ages of anguish whateer they have sufferd and done to obtain tis a pleasure a pleasure to sigh and to languish when we hope when we hope to be happy again what length of verse can serve brave mopsas good to show whose virtues strange and beauties such as no man them may know thus shrewdly burden then how can my muse escape the gods must help and precious things must serve to show her shape like great god saturn fair and like fair venus chaste as smooth as pan as juno mild like goddess iris fast with cupid she foresees and goes god vulcans pace and for a taste of all these gifts she borrows momus grace her forehead jacinth like her cheeks of opal hue her twinkling eyes bedecked with pearl her lips of sapphire blue her hair pure crapall stone her mouth o heavenly wide her skin like burnished gold her hands like silver ore untried as for those parts unknown which hidden sure are best happy be they which believe and never seek the rest i like to lie with you wordless on black cloud rooft beach in late june oclock tempest on clump weed bed with sand fitting your contours like tailor made and i like to wash my summer brown face in north cold hudson rapids with octagon soap knees niched in steamy rocks where last nights frog stared at our buddhist sleep but most of all i like to see the morning happen i like to go down vertical mountains where lanny goshkitch meditated crashing poplars sap sticky arms flailing as thermosed green tea anoints sneakers and blood soakt brow i taste and love myself a split second and i like to feel my own full scrotum as i horizon the whole crisp linen earth in my beatitude waiting miguel like in maskt fantasy for christ like you whoever you are but most of all i like to see the morning happen i like to look at books howl haikus of the seasons of the mind that i might know the knowing and the simplest to think of all of us taking turns at catching each other in the rye and i like to taste cold absinthe on hot hung sunday mornings discussing orgies symposiums and sounds with hoary headed poets in upstairs jazz club in japan but most of all i like to see the morning happen when k and ike still sleep and only the denver night riders hum contrasts to orient jazzy feather beasts in the dewy garden of real earth where i can sink my naked feet cool today is a trumpet to set the hounds baying the past is a fox the hunters are flaying nothing unspoken goes without saying loves a casino where lovers risk playing the futures a marker our hearts are prepaying the futures a promise theres no guaranteeing today is a fire the field mice are fleeing love is a marriage of feeling and being the past is a mirror for wishful sightseeing nothing goes missing without absenteeing nothing gets cloven except by dividing the future is chosen by atoms colliding the pasts an elision forever eliding today is a fog bank in which i am hiding love is a burn forever debriding loves an ascent forever plateauing nothing is granted except by bestowing today is an anthem the cuckoos are crowing the futures a convolute river onflowing the past is a lawn the neighbor is mowing the past is an answer not worth pursuing nothing gets done except by the doing the futures a climax forever ensuing love is only won by wooing today is a truce between reaping and rueing love is more thicker than forget more thinner than recall more seldom than a wave is wet more frequent than to fail it is most mad and moonly and less it shall unbe than all the sea which only is deeper than the sea love is less always than to win less never than alive less bigger than the least begin less littler than forgive it is most sane and sunly and more it cannot die than all the sky which only is higher than the sky toward what island home am i moving not wanting to marry not wanting too much of that emptiness at evening as when i walked through a field at duskand felt wide in the night and it was again the evening that drew meback to the field where i was most alone compassed by stems and ruts no light of the fixed stars no flashing in the eyes only heather pared by dry air shedding a small feathered radiance when i looked away an expanse whose deep sleep seemed an unending warren i had been given to carry out such tasks that i might find nothing dead and it was again the evening that drew meback to the field where i could sense no boundary the smell of dry earth cool arch of my neck the darkness entirely within myself and when i shut my eyes there was no one only weeds in drifts of stillness only stalks and gliding sky come black anchor let us not be harmed the deer leafing in the dark the old man at the table unable to remember the children whose hunger

just as well here in the shade behind the house protected from street noises one can go over all kinds of old feeling throw some away keep others the wordplay between us gets very intense when there are fewer feelings around to confuse things another go round no but the last things you always find to say are charming and rescue me before the night does we are afloat on our dreams as on a barge made of ice shot through with questions and fissures of starlight that keep us awake thinking about the dreams as they are happening some occurrence you said it i said it but i can hide it but i choose not to thank you you are a very pleasant person thank you you are too ask nothing more of me sweet all i can give you i give heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet love

at your feet here that must love you to live the curtains were half drawn the floor was swept and strewn with rushes rosemary and may lay thick upon the bed on which i lay where through the lattice ivy shadows crept he leaned above me thinking that i slept and could not hear him but i heard him say poor child poor child and as he turned away came a deep silence and i knew he wept he did not touch the shroud or raise the fold that hid my face or take my hand in his or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head he did not love me living but once dead he pitied me and very sweet it is to know he still is warm though i am cold yet it was plain she struggled and that salt of righteous feeling made her pitiful poor twisting worm so queenly beautiful where came the cleft between us whose the fault my tears are on thee that have rarely dropped as balm for any bitter wound of mine my breast will open for thee at a sign but no we are two reed pipes coarsely stopped the god once filled them

this unholy battle i grow base if the same soul be under the same face speak and a taste of that old time restore we snort all our coke on the way to the party we bring the new album we dance while we listen the band is two women whose husbands control them they do not speak our language each syllables an obstacle they are in love with a man he is in love with another but theyre in no hurry they could wait forever and when they are out on the make for a lover theyll always find him they are the tigers we are stoned too stoned to we dance till were tired and listen to lyrics we mouth like a language what we feel when we hear them is inexpressible we cant put into words maybe our dances show it abba lives for their music we long for each other they see what were doing they put it on record they play it we listen we are absolutely stunned we feel and they know more than anyone can say what is desire but the hardwire argument given to the minds unstoppable mouth inside the

girls so the other guys could see and shit what guts we all said all konga wanted to do over and over was the rubber band trick but he showed everyone how so nobody wanted to see anymore and one day he cried just cried until his parents took him away forever maya had a hotpoint refrigerator standing in his living room just for his family to show anybody who came that they could afford it me i got a french kiss finally in the catholic darkness my tongues farthest half vacationing loudly in another mouth like a man in bermudas and my body jumped against a flagstone wall i could feel it through her thin almost nonexistent body i had at that moment that moment a hot girl on a summer night the best of all the things we tried to do well she let me kiss her anyway all over or it was just a flagstone wall with a flaw in the stone an understanding cavity for burning young men with smooth dreams the true circumstance is gone the true circumstances about us all then are gone but when i kissed her all water she would close her eyes and they into somewhere would disappear whether she was there or not i remember her clearly and she moves around the room sometimes until i sleep i have lain on the desert in watch low in the back of a pick up truck for nothing in particular for stars for the things behind stars and nothing comes more than the moment always now here in a truck the moment again to dream of making love and sweat this time to a woman or even to all of them in some allowable way to those boys then who couldnt cry to the girls before they were women to friends me on my back the sky over me pressing its simple weight into her body on me into the bodies of them all on me would but indulgent fortune send to me a kind and faithful friend one who to virtues laws is true and does her nicest rules pursue one pious libral just and brave and to his passions not a slave who full of honour void of pride will freely praise and freely chide but not indulge the smallest fault nor entertain one slighting thought who still the same will ever prove will still instruct and still will love in whom i safely may confide and with him all my cares divide who has a large capacious mind joind with a knowledge unconfind a reason bright a judgement true a wit both quick and solid too who can of all things talk with ease and whose converse will ever please who charmd with wit and inward graces despises fools with tempting faces and still a beauteous mind does prize above the most enchanting eyes i would not envy queens their state nor once desire a happier fate there is no crumbly frozen cake to thaw today we are in the jungle i mean mosquito i mean tigers and elephants sludging their way to the lake for a drink and dont make sudden moves or snakes startled from an afternoon nap will greet you fang first i think we are lost too hot for any cold confection to survive even my tube of sunblock is as warm as a babys bottle you get to those places i cant reach those places i dared not even whisper before i walked down the aisle in white you never worried if our families would clash if they would clang like the clutch of pale monkeys clanging the thin branches of the treetrops begging for our trail mix you never worried about my relatives staring at your pale muscled calves things not usually seen outside of the bedroom you wore hiking shorts anyway and still they lavished ladle fuls of food on your plate i think we are lost my eyes are dark and wet as that wild deer that walked right past us a little off the trail i think we are lost but for once i dont mind eventually you turn us back to a place not on any map but i know i can trace it back with my finger if we ever need it again we made it one year without a compass and were not about to start now brutal to givethe prisoner a window a blue sky glimpse as if an afterlifeexisted brutalfor you to parade in a bodyin the same room where i dream you if no love is o god what fele i

withinne a boot am i amydde the see betwixen wyndes two that in contrarie stonden evere mo allas what is this wondre maladie for hete of cold for cold of hete i dye o that twere possible after long grief and pain to find the arms of my true love round me once again when i was wont to meet her in the silent woody places by the home that gave me birth we stood tranced in long embraces mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter than anything on earth a shadow flits before me not thou but like to thee ah christ that it were possible for one short hour to see the souls we loved that they might tell us what and where they be it leads me forth at evening it lightly winds and steals in a cold white robe before me when all my spirit reels at the shouts the leagues of lights and the roaring of the wheels half the night i waste in sighs half in dreams i sorrow after the delight of early skies in a wakeful doze i sorrow for the hand the lips the eyes for the meeting of the morrow the delight of happy laughter the delight of low replies tis a morning pure and sweet and a dewy splendour falls on the little flower that clings to the turrets and the walls tis a morning pure and sweet and the light and shadow fleet she is walking in the meadow and the woodland echo rings in a moment we shall meet she is singing in the meadow and the rivulet at her feet ripples on in light and shadow to the ballad that she sings so i hear her sing as of old my bird with the shining head my own dove with the tender eye but there rings on a sudden a passionate cry there is some one dying or dead and a sullen thunder is rolld for a tumult shakes the city and i wake my dream is fled in the shuddering dawn behold without knowledge without pity by the curtains of my bed that abiding phantom cold get thee hence nor come again mix not memory with doubt pass thou deathlike type of pain pass and cease to move about tis the blot upon the brain that will show itself without then i rise the eave drops fall and the yellow vapours choke the great city sounding wide the day comes a dull red ball wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke on the misty river tide thro the hubbub of the market i steal a wasted frame it crosses here it crosses there thro all that crowd confused and loud the shadow still the same and on my heavy eyelids my anguish hangs like shame alas for her that met me that heard me softly call came glimmering thro the laurels at the quiet evenfall in the garden by the turrets of the old manorial hall would the happy spirit descend from the realms of light and song in the chamber or the street as she looks among the blest should i fear to greet my friend or to say forgive the wrong or to ask her take me sweet to the regions of thy rest but the broad light glares and beats and the shadow flits and fleets and will not let me be and i loathe the squares and streets and the faces that one meets hearts with no love for me always i long to creep into some still cavern deep there to weep and weep and weep my whole soul out to thee i i woke to early sun burning of fire then afterward we kept reaching through the long night ii afterward the small deceptions we allow ourselves a sickness unchecked like this iii first sunlight snow continues i could never close my eyes to light but there was no light you looked like night iv there must be a pattern snow slow dropping in wet clusters through the wooden arms of empty trees v sun fingering its way through branches id hung my life on we dont matter a bit realization forces our eyes closed vi a sickness unchecked like this id hung my life on burning of fire then afterward vii our arms together we searched for patterns sunlight viii our arms laced together pointing together over wind tossed grasses us waist deep in night blue ix there was no light you pointed x sun overhead you pointed to the wind tossed grasses this is a memory now xi together in that first sun so vivid there must be a pattern id hung my life on xii snow dropped in clusters staggered jagged we dont matter a bit xiii reflected in lake water all these things ill forget xiv our arms together but we keep reaching over the wind tossed grasses xv black smoke curling the importance of night blue field grass xvi the importance of the stars are close we try to hold together xvii all this ends but until then burning of fire then afterward the stars are close we try to hold such distance between the fallen xviii burning of fire then afterward you pointed xix grasses silently fold a sickness unchecked reaching like this wooden arms of trees long since emptied xx this ends in darkness all the stars within reach other constellations eph what friendship is ardelia show ard tis to love as i love you eph this account so short tho kind suits not my inquiring mind therefore farther now repeat what is friendship when complete ard tis to share all joy and grief tis to lend all due relief from the tongue the heart the hand tis to mortgage house and land for a friend be sold a slave tis to die upon a grave if a friend therein do lie eph this indeed tho carried high this tho more than eer was done underneath the rolling sun this has all been said before can ardelia say no more ard words indeed no more can show but tis to love as i love you of thee kind boy i ask no red and white to make up my delight no odd becoming graces black eyes or little know not whats in faces make me but mad enough give me good store of love for her i count i ask no more tis love in love that makes the sport theres no such thing as that we beauty call it is mere cozenage all for though some long ago liked certain colors mingled so and so that doth not tie me now from choosing new if i a fancy take to black and blue that fancy doth it beauty make tis not the meat but tis the appetite makes eating a delight and if i like one dish more than another that a pheasant is what in our watches that in us is found so to the height and nick we up be wound no matter by what hand or trick i think i always liked the gamebecause it sounded like my namecombined with the concept of alone my name really does mean alone in slovenian we dont actually careif its true but we want to knowthe person telling us is telling usthe truth say his name is hank as in of hair its not my upbringingwas classically smooth chaotic apartfrom traumatic events ive never detailed even to myself traumatic but methodical but why say what happened even in the tech block the blinds were downand i cleared my way to the final marbleunder the indistinct gaze of an indistinctmaster my success had allowed meto become the bastard i always knewi could be what did it mean to cleanthe board like this counting down to one by these gradual and orderly subtractionsmy persona was configured the goalwas to remain single sometimes telling youthe truth wouldnt be telling you anythingmuch for a while ive felt torpid and detuned as if i want to share a view with you so we can both be absent in one place look the sky is beautiful and sour im not here too im staring out of this cloudlike an anagram whose solutionis probably itself i am only the methodthat this stupid game was invented to explain clindor sir why so restless is there any need with all your fame for one more glorious deed have you not slain enough bold foes by now and must you have fresh laurels for your brow matamore its true im restless and i cant decide which of two foes should first be nullified the mogul emperor or the persian sophy clindor ah let them live a while sir neither trophy would add a great deal to your fame and standing and wheres the army that youd be commanding matamore army ah villain coward do you doubt that with this arm alone id wipe them out the mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield and drives divisions from the battlefield my wrath against these rulers needs engage only a piddling portion of my rage with one commandment given to the fates i oust the strongest monarchs from their states thunders my cannon my troops the destinies one blow lays low a thousand enemies one breath and all their hopes go up in smoke yet you dare speak of armies what a joke no longer shall a second mars employ you with but a glance you rogue i shall destroy you and yet the thought of her whom i adore softens me now and im enraged no more that little archer whom every god obeys forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays observe how my ferocity which hates and hacks and slaughters gently dissipates when i recall my lady and my face is changed by thoughts of beauty love and grace clindor oh sir you have a hundred selves or more youre as handsome now as you were grim before i cant imagine any lady who could stubbornly refuse her heart to you matamore whatever i may have said feel no alarm sometimes i terrify sometimes i charm depending on my humor i inspire men with anxiety women with desire before i had the power to suppress my beauty women gave me much distress when i appeared they swooned in quantity and thousands died each day for love of me with every princess i had many a tryst and every queen came begging to be kissed the ethiopian and the japanese murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas two sultanesses could not but adore me two more escaped from the seraglio f r me which strained my friendship with the turkish nation clindor their anger could but gild your reputation matamore still all that was more trouble than it was worth it balked my plans for conquering the earth whats more i tired of it and to deter such nuisances sent word to jupiter that if he could not put a stop to these fond women and their importunities id rise up in a rage and end his reign as ruler of the gods and would obtain for mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder needless to say the coward knuckled under he did as i desired and now you see im handsome only when i choose to be clindor what love notes youd receive were that not so matamore dont bring me any unless from her you know what does she say of me clindor today she said that you inspire all hearts with love and dread and that if what you promise her comes true shell feel herself a goddess thanks to you matamore back in the times ive just been speaking of goddesses also pestered me for love and i shall tell you of a strange event which caused confusion without precedent and threw all nature into disarray the sun was powerless to rise one day because that bright much worshipped deity could not find where the dawn his guide might be he sought her everywhere in cephalus bower in old tithonus bed in memnons tower but since aurora nowhere was in sight the day till noontide was as black as night clindor where was the goddess during these alarms matamore in my bedchamber offering me her charms but she gained nothing by such shameless actions my heart was blind to all her bright attractions and all she got by showing off her beauty was a firm command to go and do her duty clindor that curious story sir i now recall i was in mexico where i heard it all they said that persia vexed by the insult to their famous sun god had it in for you matamore i heard as much and would have made them pay but was in transylvania that day where their ambassador hastened to appease my wrath with presents and apologies clindor your brave heart showed them clemency how fine matamore just look my friend upon this face of mine there every human virtue can be found of all the foes ive stamped into the ground whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside there was not one who did not fall through pride but those who humbly honored my perfection have kept their power through a wise subjection the modest kings of europe are all my vassals i do not sack their towns or wreck their castles i let them reign but its another story in africa where i scorched the territory of certain kings who lacked humility and left great deserts there for all to see those endless sands beneath those skies of fire are a great monument to my righteous ire clindor let us revert to love your ladys here matamore my curs d rivals at her side i fear clindor where are you going matamore he isnt brave this dunce and yet hes vain and could be bold for once perhaps hell challenge me from foolish pride merely because hes at the ladys side clindor by doing so the fool might come to harm matamore i cant be valorous when im full of charm clindor cease to be charming and be terrible sir matamore oh you dont realize what that would incur i cant be terrible by halves you know id slaughter both my mistress and my foe until they part lets stand aside and wait clindor your prudence like your valor is very great they withdraw to a corner stone by stone body by body in the grass for this we trade our lone compass become swans instead adrift in glaze light kilned in the arms of each other into vessel vassal new or shrew as the case may be what would you do listen to the footsteps in the thistles put the kettle on for tea and whisper it to me loving in truth and fain in verse my love to show that she dear she might take some pleasure of my pain pleasure might cause her read reading might make her know knowledge might pity win and pity grace obtain i sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe studying inventions fine her wits to entertain oft turning others leaves to see if thence would flow some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnd brain but words came halting forth wanting inventions stay invention natures child fled step dame studys blows and others feet still seemd but strangers in my way thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes biting my truant pen beating myself for spite fool said my muse to me look in thy heart and write the wine of love is music and the feast of love is song and when love sits down to the banquet love sits long sits long and ariseth drunken but not with the feast and the wine he reeleth with his own heart that great rich vine doing a filthy pleasure is and short and done we straight repent us of the sport let us not then rush blindly on unto it like lustful beasts that only know to do it for lust will languish and that heat decay but thus thus keeping endless holiday let us together closely lie and kiss there is no labour nor no shame in this this hath pleased doth please and long will please never can this decay but is beginning ever in the hermetic almost dark under the fluorescent dizz i found her broken nerves smoke coming off the dashes the caps like jolts to the neck the pried open spaces between vowels where the teeth bit off twine and the tongue was raw then cool with ice the air of the stockroom after lunch was the marbleized silence of the small blank pages she stitched into privacy air of paper and faint glue bond carbon graph yellow pads in the stockroom i could read alone the confetti of money dissolved on the blank wall after work i slid the numbered poems on blue mimeo into my playbook and felt the open field the zig zagging past cornerbacks the white lines skewed to heaven excuse my mood unbridled chemical her scrawled messages smooth to the mind excuse my absence again and yes then too the cold stone of the palisades was there after we split alone naked in the hudson the water greasing me in the tepid chemical mix before i returned to the cement of w in my fathers skylark the night black and soundless within the rain whistled a taxi brought me to your apartment building and there i stood i had dreamed a dream of us in a bedroom the light shining upon us in white sheets you were singing me a song of your sailing days and in the dream i reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal which in bright red flew out the window sometimes when we talk on the phone i think to myself that the deep perfect of your soul is what draws me to you but still what soul is perfect all souls are misshapen and off colored morning comes within a soul and makes it obey another law in which all souls are snowflakes once at a funeral a man had died and with the prayers said his soul flew up in a hurry like it had been let out of something awful it was strangely colored that soul and it was a funny shape and a funny temperature as it blew away all of us looking felt the cold when i see birches bend to left and right across the lines of straighter darker trees i like to think some boys been swinging them but swinging doesnt bend them down to stay as ice storms do often you must have seen them loaded with ice a sunny winter morning after a rain they click upon themselves as the breeze rises and turn many colored as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel soon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells shattering and avalanching on the snow crust such heaps of broken glass to sweep away youd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load and they seem not to break though once they are bowed so low for long they never right themselves you may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards trailing their leaves on the ground like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads to dry in the sun but i was going to say when truth broke in with all her matter of fact about the ice storm i should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows some boy too far from town to learn baseball whose only play was what he found himself summer or winter and could play alone one by one he subdued his fathers trees by riding them down over and over again until he took the stiffness out of them and not one but hung limp not one was left for him to conquer he learned all there was to learn about not launching out too soon and so not carrying the tree away clear to the ground he always kept his poise to the top branches climbing carefully with the same pains you use to fill a cup up to the brim and even above the brim then he flung outward feet first with a swish kicking his way down through the air to the ground so was i once myself a swinger of birches and so i dream of going back to be its when im weary of considerations and life is too much like a pathless wood where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs broken across it and one eye is weeping from a twigs having lashed across it open id like to get away from earth awhile and then come back to it and begin over may no fate willfully misunderstand me and half grant what i wish and snatch me away not to return earths the right place for love i dont know where its likely to go better id like to go by climbing a birch tree and climb black branches up a snow white trunktoward heaven till the tree could bear no more but dipped its top and set me down again that would be good both going and coming back one could do worse than be a swinger of birches walking to the hospital how the autumn dawn burned throughthe misty broods and settled down in fire how quickly the sun glittered my shadow how my shadow cried a moment with joy a light frost a vision of light cracklingdown the maples down the tinder ash i was the good thief i held my lovessweet breath his beautiful intelligent gaze i closed my eyes and he woke inside me when i saw he saw the inflamed world a bird sang deeply from the gutter eaves when i closed my eyes i was elsewhere i walked through the fire of his sleep leaving early my love tonight fionnuala is your nurse youll hear her voice sing song around the ward lifting a wing at the shore of your darkness i heard that in another life she too journeyed through a storm a kind of curse with the ocean rising darkly around her fierce with cold and no resting place only the frozen rocks that tore her feet the light on her shoulders and no cure there but to wait it out if while im gone your fever comes down if the small salt laden shapes of her song appear as a first glimmer of earth light follow the sweet hopeful voice of that landing she will keep you safe beneath her wing in your sleep after the lark ascending by ralph vaughan williams the moment the lark finally vanishes into the spread green sky of the forest is the moment you suddenly lift your bruised arm up over your body as though to show me the wings eclipse or the wing or the season of your dream and even as your hand lapses silent onto your chest and your breath goes sluggish i am already watching your feet prepare their slow first step under the sheet as the last notes of sunlight fall quiet and you do not move again my love are you a bird reviving in a summer field was it the lark ascending that you heard a ghost among its shy hearted tunes yes i heard the lark escaping too brown brandy brown leaf brown russet malayan yellow express train berlin trelleborg

surging in evening haste over roofs and hermetic grim walls last night as if death had lit a pale light in your flesh your flesh was cold to my touch or not cold but cool cooling as if the last traces of warmth were still fading in you my thigh burned in cold fear where yours touched it but i forced to mind my vision of a sky close and enclosed unlike the space in which these clouds move a sky of gray mist it appeared and how looking intently at it we saw its gray was not gray but a milky white in which radiant traces of opal greens fiery blues gleamed faded gleamed again and how only then seeing the color in the gray a field sprang into sight extending between where we stood and the horizon a field of freshest deep spiring grass starred with dandelions green and gold gold and green

i saved the rest for you when she doesnt respond i know shes used up all her words so i slowly whisper i love you thirty two and a third times after that we just sit on the line and listen to each

so handsome for a reason it was made out of your rib it continues with my skidmarked by a dressbody i stand on the borderon heels like my sixth toesand show youwhere to park that very nightlying together in the dogs yard flowers are biting my back you whisper the longer i look on the coins of your nipples the clearer i see the queens profile for you body and money are the same as the chicken and the egg the metaphor of a womans purse escapes you stealing you like to mumble a purse is a purse is a purse is a purse also a real purse in your hand is worth two metaphorical purses over your mouth they tell me you are a body anchored to the shore by its rusting blood your wound darkens on your chest like a crow i tell them as agreed that you are my youth an apple that bit into me to forget its own knowledge death hands you every new day like a golden coin as the bribe growsit gets harder to turn it down your heart of gold gets heavier to carry your hands know that a car has a waistand a gun a lobe you take me where the river once lifted its skirtsand god abashed with that view ordered to cover that shame with a city its dance squareshrank by the darkness to the sizeof a sleeping infants slightly open mouth i cannot tell between beggars stretched hands and dogs dripping tongues you cannot tell between legs mine tables chairs others that dance square is a cagewhere accordions grin at dismembered violin torsos beggars lick thin air off their lips women whirling in salsa slash you across the chest with the bladesof their skirts soiled with peonies i drowned in the fire of having you i burned in the river of not having you we lived together for hours in a house of a thousand rooms and we were parted for a thousand years ten minutes ago we raised our children who cover the earth and have forgotten that we existed it was not maya it was not a ladder to perfection it was this cold sunlight falling on this warm earth when i turned you went to hell when your ship fled the battle i followed you and lost the world without regret but with stormy recriminations someday far down that corridor of horror the future someone who buys this picture of you for the frame at a stall in a dwindled city will study your face and decide to harbor it for a little while longer from the waters of anonymity the acids of breath to the dim light and the large circle of shade i have clomb and to the whitening of the hills there where we see no color in the grass natheless my longing loses not its green it has so taken root in the hard stone which talks and hears as though it were a lady utterly frozen is this youthful lady even as the snow that lies within the shade for she is no more moved than is the stone by the sweet season which makes warm the hills and alters them afresh from white to green covering their sides again with flowers and grass when on her hair she sets a crown of grass the thought has no more room for other lady because she weaves the yellow with the green so well that love sits down there in the shade love who has shut me in among low hills faster than between walls of granite stone she is more bright than is a precious stone the wound she gives may not be healed with grass i therefore have fled far oer plains and hills for refuge from so dangerous a lady but from her sunshine nothing can give shade not any hill nor wall nor summer green a while ago i saw her dressed in green so fair she might have wakened in a stone this love which i do feel even for her shade and therefore as one woos a graceful lady i wooed her in a field that was all grass girdled about with very lofty hills yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills before loves flame in this damp wood and green burn as it burns within a youthful lady for my sake who would sleep away in stone my life or feed like beasts upon the grass only to see her garments cast a shade how dark soeer the hills throw out their shade under her summer green the beautiful lady covers it like a stone coverd in grass now that i have cooled to you let there be gold of tarnished masonry temples soothed by the sun to ruin that sleep utterly give me hand for the dances ripples at philae in and out and lips my lesbian wall flowers that once were flame your hair is my carthage and my arms the bow and our words arrows to shoot the stars who from that misty sea swarm to destroy us but you there beside me oh how shall i defy you who wound me in the night with breasts shining like venus and like mars the night that is shouting jason when the loud eaves rattle as with waves above me blue at the prow of my desire memory hither come and tune your merry notes and while upon the wind your music floats ill pore upon the stream where sighing lovers dream and fish for fancies as they pass within the watery glass ill drink of the clear stream and hear the linnets song and there ill lie and dream the day along and when night comes ill go to places fit for woe walking along the darkend valley with silent melancholy prologue if the sea could dream and if the sea were dreaming now the dream would be the usual one of the flesh the letter written in the dream would go something like forgive me love blue i the viewing a chorus o what then did he look like he had a good body and how came you to know this his body was naked say the sound of his body his body was quiet say again quiet he was sleeping you are sure of this sleeping inside it yes inside it ii pavilion sometimes a breeze a canvas flap will rise and inside someone stirs a bird a flower one is thinking should there be thirst i have only to reach for the swollen bag of skin beside me i have only to touch my mouth that is meant for a flower to it and drink one is for now certain he is one of those poems that stop only they do not end one says without actually saying iti am sometimes a book of such poems i am other times a flower and lovely pressed like so among them but always they forget me i miss my name they are all of them heat weary anxious for evening as for some beautiful to the bone messenger to come they will open again for him his hands are good his message is a flower iii the tasting a chorus o what then did he taste like he tasted of sorrow and how came you to know this my tongue still remembers say the taste that is sorrow game fallen unfairly and yet you still tasted still i tasted did you say to him something i could not speak for hunger iv interior and now the candle blooms gorgeously away from his hand and the light has made blameless all over the body of him mystery mystery twelvefold shining by grace of twelve mirrors the moth cant stop attending singly in no order it flutters against beats the glass of each one as someone elsewhere is maybe beating upon a strange door now somebody knocks and knocks at a new country of which nothing is understood no danger occurs to him though danger could be any of the unusually wild flowers that either side of the road spring when he slows bends down and closer to see or to take one it is as if he knows something to tell it v the dreaming a chorus o what then did it feel like i dreamed of an arrow and how came you to know him i dreamed he was wanting say the dream of him wanting a swan a wing folding why do you weep now i remember tell what else you remember the swan was mutilated envoi and i came to where was nothing but drowning and more drowning and saw to where the sea besides flesh was as well littered with boats how each was blue but trimmed with white to each a name i didnt know and then recalling did and ignoring the flesh that burning gives more stink than heat i dragged what boats i could to the shore and piled them severally in a tree less space and lit a fire that didnt take at first the wood was wet and then helped by the wind became a blaze so high the sea itself along with the bodies in it seemed to burn i watched as each boat fell to flame vincent and matthew and last what bore your name tell me no more of minds embracing minds and hearts exchangd for hearts that spirits spirits meet as winds do winds and mix their subtlest parts that two unbodied essences may kiss and then like angels twist and feel one bliss i was that silly thing that once was wrought to practise this thin love i climbd from sex to soul from soul to thought but thinking there to move headlong i rolled from thought to soul and then from soul i lighted at the sex again as some strict down looked men pretend to fast who yet in closets eat so lovers who profess they spirits taste feed yet on grosser meat i know they boast they souls to souls convey hower they meet the body is the way come i will undeceive thee they that tread those vain aerial ways are like young heirs and alchemists misled to waste their wealth and days for searching thus to be for ever rich they only find a medcine for the itch half eagle half lion the fabulous animal struts saber clawed but saintly a

arrowing towards home how do we ignore it the attenuated being of our age the bittersweet collapse of dominoes mooned around our pine withered with hatred from his quarter saint stephen even at death rolled mercifully over in high holiness sonless wifeless nine thousand feet from land i roll the lozenge on my tongue youthful habit for ache of any kind parting a survivor wait love rescuing me from the fringe version yours is the shame and sorrow but the disgrace is mine your love was dark and thorough mine was the love of the sun for a flower he creates with his shine i was diligent to explore you blossom you stalk by stalk till my fire of creation bore you shrivelling down in the final dour anguish then i suffered a balk i knew your pain and it broke my fine craftsmans nerve your body quailed at my stroke and my courage failed to give you the last fine torture you did deserve you are shapely you are adorned but opaque and dull in the flesh who had i but pierced with the thorned fire threshing anguish were fused and cast in a lovely illumined mesh like a painted window the best suffering burnt through your flesh undrossed it and left it blest with a quivering sweet wisdom of grace but now who shall take you afresh now who will burn you free from your bodys terrors and dross since the fire has failed in me what man will stoop in your flesh to plough the shrieking cross a mute nearly beautiful thing is your face that fills me with shame as i see it hardening warping the perfect image of god and darkening my eternal fame version yours is the sullen sorrow the disgrace is also mine your love was intense and thorough mine was the love of a growing flower for the sunshine you had the power to explore me blossom me stalk by stalk you woke my spirit you bore me to consciousness you gave me the dour awareness then i suffered a balk body to body i could not love you although i would we kissed we kissed though we should not you yielded we threw the last cast and it was no good you only endured and it broke my craftsmans nerve no flesh responded to my stroke so i failed to give you the last fine torture you did deserve you are shapely you are adorned but opaque and null in the flesh who had i but pierced with the thorned full anguish perhaps had been cast in a lovely illuinined mesh like a painted window the best fire passed through your flesh undrossed it and left it blest in clean new awareness but now who shall take you afresh now who will burn you free from your bodys deadness and dross since the fire has failed in me what man will stoop in your flesh to plough the shrieking cross a mute nearly beautiful thing is your face that fills me with shame as i see it hardening i should have been cruel enough to bring you through the flame i went back as to my relatives when i arrived the elms had been shaved but you were all the same the buildings the dry classrooms i embraced your eyes your avenues you were fixed in the same expressions your flat voices your dental work like your lips slipping over words already said additional agricultural pamphlets many of you sat in private offices why did i think i could drag it all back the former edge of town where streets ended in fields under clouds puffed like the french phrases he kissed me with in the sucked in breath of that illusive happiness coming back listening looking ready to take your bodies in my hands returning to streets that had poured heavy shopping malls over the hay sweet grass where he and i lay whispering the most important nonsense of my desperate and embittered life a page a huntsman and a priest of god her lovers met in jealous contrarietyequally claiming the sole parenthood of him the perfect crown of their variety then whom to admit herself she could not tell that always was her fate she loved too well but many fathered little one she said whether of high or low of smooth or rough here is your mother whom you brought to bed acknowledge only me be this enough for such as worship after shall be tolda white dove sired you or a rain of gold under yonder beech tree single on the green sward couched with her arms behind her golden head knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly lies my young love sleeping in the shade had i the heart to slide an arm beneath her press her parting lips as her waist i gather slow waking in amazement she could not but embrace me then would she hold me and never let me go shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow swift as the swallow along the rivers light circleting the surface to meet his mirrored winglets fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine tops wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun she whom i love is hard to catch and conquer hard but o the glory of the winning were she won when her mother tends her before the laughing mirror tying up her laces looping up her hair often she thinks were this wild thing wedded more love should i have and much less care when her mother tends her before the lighted mirror loosening her laces combing down her curls often she thinks were this wild thing wedded i should miss but one for many boys and girls heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon no she is athirst and drinking up her wonder earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon deals she an unkindness tis but her rapid measure even as in a dance and her smile can heal no less like the swinging may cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones off a sunny border she was made to bruise and bless lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping wavy in the dusk lit by one large star lone on the fir branch his rattle note unvaried brooding oer the gloom spins the brown eve jar darker grows the valley more and more forgetting so were it with me if forgetting could be willed tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well spring tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled stepping down the hill with her fair companions arm in arm all against the raying west boldly she sings to the merry tune she marches brave in her shape and sweeter unpossessed sweeter for she is what my heart first awaking whispered the world was morning light is she love that so desires would fain keep her changeless fain would fling the net and fain have her free happy happy time when the white star hovers low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew near the face of dawn that draws athwart the darkness threading it with colour as yewberries the yew thicker crowd the shades while the grave east deepens glowing and with crimson a long cloud swells maiden still the morn is and strange she is and secret strange her eyes her cheeks are cold as cold sea shells sunrays leaning on our southern hills and lighting wild cloud mountains that drag the hills along oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter chill as a dull face frowning on a song ay but shows the south west a ripple feathered bosom blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend scaling the mid heavens as they stream there comes a sunset rich deep like love in beauty without end when at dawn she sighs and like an infant to the window turns grave eyes craving light released from dreams beautiful she looks like a white water lily bursting out of bud in havens of the streams when from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle in her long nightgown sweet as boughs of may beautiful she looks like a tall garden lily pure from the night and splendid for the day mother of the dews dark eye lashed twilight low lidded twilight oer the valleys brim rounding on thy breast sings the dew delighted skylark clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him hidden where the rose flush drinks the rayless planet fountain full he pours the spraying fountain showers let me hear her laughter i would have her ever cool as dew in twilight the lark above the flowers all the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose up lanes woods through they troop in joyful bands my sweet leads she knows not why but now she totters eyes the bent anemones and hangs her hands such a look will tell that the violets are peeping coming the rose and unaware a cry springs in her bosom for odours and for colour covert and the nightingale she knows not why kerchiefed head and chin she darts between her tulips streaming like a willow grey in arrowy rain some bend beaten cheek to gravel and their angel she will be she lifts them and on she speeds again black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway she is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth so when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder saw i once a white dove sole light of earth prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden trained to stand in rows and asking if they please i might love them well but for loving more the wild ones o my wild ones they tell me more than these you my wild one you tell of honied field rose violet blushing eglantine in life and even as they they by the wayside are earnest of your goodness you are of lifes on the banks that line the way peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three parted is the window she sleeps the starry jasmine breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me sweeter unpossessed have i said of her my sweetest not while she sleeps while she sleeps the jasmine breathes luring her to love she sleeps the starry jasmine bears me to her pillow under white rose wreaths yellow with birdfoot trefoil are the grass glades yellow with cinquefoil of the dew grey leaf yellow with stonecrop the moss mounds are yellow blue necked the wheat sways yellowing to the sheaf green yellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens thinking of the harvest i look and think of mine this i may know her dressing and undressing such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport shift from cloud to moonlight or edging over thunder slips a ray of sun or sweeping into port white sails furl or on the ocean borders white sails lean along the waves leaping green visions of her shower before me but from eyesight guarded she would be like the sun were she seen front door and back of the mossed old farmhouse open with the morn and in a breezy link freshly sparkles garden to stripe shadowed orchard green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink busy in the grass the early sun of summer swarms and the blackbirds mellow fluting notes call my darling up with round and roguish challenge quaintest richest carol of all the singing throats cool was the woodside cool as her white dairy keeping sweet the cream pan and there the boys from school cricketing below rushed brown and red with sunshine o the dark translucence of the deep eyed cool spying from the farm herself she fetched a pitcher full of milk and tilted for each in turn the beak then a little fellow mouth up and on tiptoe said i will kiss you she laughed and leaned her cheek doves of the fir wood walling high our red roof through the long noon coo crooning through the coo loose droop the leaves and down the sleepy roadway sometimes pipes a chaffinch loose droops the blue cows flap a slow tail knee deep in the river breathless given up to sun and gnat and fly nowhere is she seen and if i see her nowhere lightning may come straight rains and tiger sky o the golden sheaf the rustling treasure armful o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced o the treasure tresses one another over nodding o the girdle slack about the waist slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet quick amid the wheatears wound about the waist gathered see these brides of earth one blush of ripeness o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced large and smoky red the suns cold disk drops clipped by naked hills on violet shaded snow eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow nightlong on black print branches our beech tree gazes in this whiteness nightlong could i here may life on death or death on life be painted let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die gossips count her faults they scour a narrow chamber where there is no window read not heaven or her when she was a tiny one aged woman quavers plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear faults she had once as she learnt to run and tumbled faults of feature some see beauty not complete yet good gossips beauty that makes holy earth and air may have faults from head to feet hither she comes she comes to me she lingers deepens her brown eyebrows while in new surprise high rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger yet am i the light and living of her eyes something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming nets her in her blushes and wounds her and tames sure of her haven o like a dove alighting arms up she dropped our souls were in our names soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise yellow oats and brown wheat barley pale as rye long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher felt the girdle loosened seen the tresses fly soon will she lie like a blood red sunset swift with the to morrow green winged spring sing from the south west bring her back the truants nightingale and swallow song and dipping wing soft new beech leaves up to beamy april spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain you lucid in the moon raise lilies to the skyfields youngest green transfused in silver shining through fairer than the lily than the wild white cherry fair as in image my seraph love appears borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears could i find a place to be alone with heaven i would speak my heart out heaven is my need every woodland tree is flushing like the dog wood flashing like the whitebeam swaying like the reed flushing like the dog wood crimson in october streaming like the flag reed south west blown flashing as in gusts the sudden lighted white beam all seem to know what is for heaven alone yet i am i exists i hasa body when i seemy wifes slender boyish legs the roof of my mouth goes dry she takes my toein her mouth bites lightly how do we live on earth mosquito if i could hear you what would you say your answer mosquito above all bewareof sadnesson earth we can do cant we what we want o never say that i was false of heart though absence seemed my flame to qualify as easy might i from myself depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love if i have ranged like him that travels i return again just to the time not with the time exchanged so that myself bring water for my stain never believe though in my nature reigned all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood that it could so preposterously be stained to leave for nothing all thy sum of good for nothing this wide universe i call save thou my rose in it thou art my all ah whither love wilt thou now carry me what wontless fury dost thou now inspire into my feeble breast too full of thee whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire thou in me kindlest much more great desire and up aloft above my strength dost raise the wondrous matter of my fire to praise that as i erst in praise of thine own name so now in honour of thy mother dear an honourable hymn i eke should frame and with the brightness of her beauty clear the ravishd hearts of gazeful men might rear to admiration of that heavenly light from whence proceeds such soul enchanting might thereto do thou great goddess queen of beauty mother of love and of all worlds delight without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight do thou vouchsafe with thy love kindling light t illuminate my dim and dulled eyne and beautify this sacred hymn of thine that both to thee to whom i mean it most and eke to her whose fair immortal beam hath darted fire into my feeble ghost that now it wasted is with woes extreme it may so please that she at length will stream some dew of grace into my withered heart after long sorrow and consuming smart what time this worlds great workmaster did cast to make all things such as we now behold it seems that he before his eyes had placd a goodly pattern to whose perfect mould he fashiond them as comely as he could that now so fair and seemly they appear as nought may be amended anywhere that wondrous pattern wheresoeer it be whether in earth laid up in secret store or else in heaven that no man may it see with sinful eyes for fear it to deflore is perfect beauty which all men adore whose face and feature doth so much excel all mortal sense that none the same may tell thereof as every earthly thing partakes or more or less by influence divine so it more fair accordingly it makes and the gross matter of this earthly mine which clotheth it thereafter doth refine doing away the dross which dims the light of that fair beam which therein is empight for through infusion of celestial power the duller earth it quickneth with delight and lifeful spirits privily doth pour through all the parts that to the lookers sight they seem to please that is thy sovereign might o cyprian queen which flowing from the beam of thy bright star thou into them dost stream that is the thing which giveth pleasant grace to all things fair that kindleth lively fire light of thy lamp which shining in the face thence to the soul darts amorous desire and robs the hearts of those which it admire therewith thou pointest thy sons poisond arrow that wounds the life and wastes the inmost marrow how vainly then do idle wits invent that beauty is nought else but mixture made of colours fair and goodly temprament of pure complexions that shall quickly fade and pass away like to a summers shade or that it is but comely composition of parts well measurd with meet disposition hath white and red in it such wondrous power that it can pierce through th eyes unto the heart and therein stir such rage and restless stour as nought but death can stint his dolours smart or can proportion of the outward part move such affection in the inward mind that it can rob both sense and reason blind why do not then the blossoms of the field which are arrayd with much more orient hue and to the sense most dainty odours yield work like impression in the lookers view or why do not fair pictures like power shew in which oft times we nature see of art excelld in perfect limning every part but ah believe me there is more than so that works such wonders in the minds of men i that have often provd too well it know and whoso list the like assays to ken shall find by trial and confess it then that beauty is not as fond men misdeem an outward shew of things that only seem for that same goodly hue of white and red with which the cheeks are sprinkled shall decay and those sweet rosy leaves so fairly spread upon the lips shall fade and fall away to that they were even to corrupted clay that golden wire those sparkling stars so bright shall turn to dust and lose their goodly light but that fair lamp from whose celestial ray that light proceeds which kindleth lovers fire shall never be extinguishd nor decay but when the vital spirits do expire unto her native planet shall retire for it is heavenly born and cannot die being a parcel of the purest sky for when the soul the which derived was at first out of that great immortal spright by whom all live to love whilom did pass down from the top of purest heavens height to be embodied here it then took light and lively spirits from that fairest star which lights the world forth from his fiery car which power retaining still or more or less when she in fleshly seed is eft enraced through every part she doth the same impress according as the heavens have her graced and frames her house in which she will be placed fit for herself adorning it with spoil of th heavenly riches which she robbd erewhile thereof it comes that these fair souls which have the most resemblance of that heavenly light frame to themselves most beautiful and brave their fleshly bower most fit for their delight and the gross matter by a sovereign might tempers so trim that it may well be seen a palace fit for such a virgin queen so every spirit as it is most pure and hath in it the more of heavenly light so it the fairer body doth procure to habit in and it more fairly dight with cheerful grace and amiable sight for of the soul the body form doth take for soul is form and doth the body make therefore wherever that thou dost behold a comely corpse with beauty fair endued know this for certain that the same doth hold a beauteous soul with fair conditions thewed fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed for all that fair is is by nature good that is a sign to know the gentle blood yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind dwells in deformed tabernacle drownd either by chance against the course of kind or through unaptness in the substance found which it assumed of some stubborn ground that will not yield unto her forms direction but is deformd with some foul imperfection and oft it falls ay me the more to rue that goodly beauty albe heavenly born is foul abusd and that celestial hue which doth the world with her delight adorn made but the bait of sin and sinners scorn whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it but every one doth seek but to deprave it yet nath more is that fair beautys blame but theirs that do abuse it unto ill nothing so good but that through guilty shame may be corrupt and wrested unto will natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still however flesh e s fault it filthy make for things immortal no corruption take but ye fair dames the worlds dear ornaments and lively images of heavens light let not your beams with such disparagements be dimmd and your bright glory darkned quite but mindful still of your first countrys sight do still preserve your first informed grace whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face loathe that foul blot that hellish firebrand disloyal lust fair beautys foulest blame that base affections which your ears would bland commend to you by loves abused name but is indeed the bondslave of defame which will the garland of your glory mar and quench the light of your bright shining star but gentle love that loyal is and true will more illumine your resplendent ray and add more brightness to your goodly hue from light of his pure fire which by like way kindled of yours your likeness doth display like as two mirrors by opposd reflection do both express the faces first impression therefore to make your beauty more appear it you behoves to love and forth to lay that heavenly riches which in you ye bear that men the more admire their fountain may for else what booteth that celestial ray if it in darkness be enshrined ever that it of loving eyes be viewed never but in your choice of loves this well advise that likest to yourselves ye them select the which your forms first source may sympathize and with like beautys parts be inly deckt for if you loosely love without respect it is no love but a discordant war whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar for love is a celestial harmony of likely hearts composd of stars concent which join together in sweet sympathy to work each others joy and true content which they have harbourd since their first descent out of their heavenly bowers where they did see and know each other here belovd to be then wrong it were that any other twain should in loves gentle band combined be but those whom heaven did at first ordain and made out of one mould the more t agree for all that like the beauty which they see straight do not love for love is not so light as straight to burn at first beholders sight but they which love indeed look otherwise with pure regard and spotless true intent drawing out of the object of their eyes a more refined form which they present unto their mind void of all blemishment which it reducing to her first perfection beholdeth free from fleshs frail infection and then conforming it unto the light which in itself it hath remaining still of that first sun yet sparkling in his sight thereof he fashions in his higher skill an heavenly beauty to his fancys will and it embracing in his mind entire the mirror of his own thought doth admire which seeing now so inly fair to be as outward it appeareth to the eye and with his spirits proportion to agree he thereon fixeth all his fantasy and fully setteth his felicity counting it fairer than it is indeed and yet indeed her fairness doth exceed for lovers eyes more sharply sighted be than other mens and in dear loves delight see more than any other eyes can see through mutual receipt of beam e s bright which carry privy message to the spright and to their eyes that inmost fair display as plain as light discovers dawning day therein they see through amorous eye glances armies of loves still flying to and fro which dart at them their little fiery lances whom having wounded back again they go carrying compassion to their lovely foe who seeing her fair eyes so sharp effect cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect in which how many wonders do they rede to their conceit that others never see now of her smiles with which their souls they feed like gods with nectar in their banquets free now of her looks which like to cordials be but when her words emb ssade forth she sends lord how sweet music that unto them lends sometimes upon her forehead they behold a thousand graces masking in delight sometimes within her eyelids they unfold ten thousand sweet belgards which to their sight do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night but on her lips like rosy buds in may so many millions of chaste pleasures play all those o cytherea and thousands more thy handmaids be which do on thee attend to deck thy beauty with their dainties store that may it more to mortal eyes commend and make it more admird of foe and friend that in mens hearts thou mayst thy throne install and spread thy lovely kingdom over all then i triumph o great beautys queen advance the banner of thy conquest high that all this world the which thy vassals bene may draw to thee and with due fealty adore the power of thy great majesty singing this hymn in honour of thy name compild by me which thy poor liegeman am in lieu whereof grant o great sovereign that she whose conquering beauty doth captive my trembling heart in her eternal chain one drop of grace at length will to me give that i her bounden thrall by her may live and this same life which first fro me she reaved may owe to her of whom i it received and you fair venus darling my dear dread fresh flower of grace great goddess of my life when your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read deign to let fall one drop of due relief that may recure my hearts long pining grief and shew what wondrous power your beauty hath that can restore a damned wight from death wed often been included in the weather whose changes as in the still portending darknesses of after noon were hardly evident if even manifest at all the august rain over mixcoac the deadening of all aspect at a distance yet our sudden wet bodies firm swelling divested finally of shirts trousers left beside turbid footprints on the tiled floor this tongue these lips the lightning over the unchartered landscape of your thigh successive terra nova to resist the still life of the body when you are old and grey and full of sleep and nodding by the fire take down this book and slowly read and dream of the soft look your eyes had once and of their shadows deep how many loved your moments of glad grace and loved your beauty with love false or true but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you and loved the sorrows of your changing face and bending down beside the glowing bars murmur a little sadly how love fled and paced upon the mountains overhead and hid his face amid a crowd of stars one version of the story is i wish you back that i used each evening evening out what all day spent wrinkling i bought a dress that was so extravagantly feminine you could see my ovaries through it this is how i thought i would seduce you this is how frantic i hollowed out another way of telling it is to hire some kind of gnarled and symbolic troll to make a tape recording of plastic beads coming unglued from a childs jewelry box this might be an important sound like serotonin or mighty mitochondria so your body hears about how you stole the ring made from a glittery opiate and the locket that held candy its only fair that i present yet another side as insidious as it is because two sides hold up nothing but each other a tentacled skepticism a suspended contempt such fancies and toxins form a third wall a mean way to end and i never dreamed we meant it another way of putting it is like slathering jam on a scrape do sweets soothe pain or simply make it stick which is the worst so much technology and no fix for sticky if you cant taste it i mean theres no relief unless so im coming all this excitement to your house to a place where theres no room for play it is possible youll lock me out and ill finally focus on making mudcakes look solid in the rain in some cultures the story told is slightly different in that it is set in an aquarium and the audience participates as various fish the twist comes when it is revealed that the most personally attractive fish have eyes only on one side and repel each other like magnets the starfish is the size of an eraser and does as much damage starfish the eponymous and still unlikely hero has those five pink moving suckerpads that allow endless permutations so no solid memory no recent history nothing better left unsaid the story exists even when there are no witnesses kissers tellers because secrets secrete and these versions tend to be slapstick as if in a candy factory the chocolate belted down the conveyor too fast or everyone turned sideways at the same time by accident this little tale tries so hard to be humorous wants so badly to win affection and to lodge because nothing is truly forgotten and loved three million richards cant be wrong so when they levy a critique of an undertaking which in their view overtakes i take it seriously they think one may start a tale off whingy and wretched in a regular voice but when one strikes out whimsically as if meta is better as if it isnt you as if this story is happening to nobody it is only who you are fooling thats nobody the richards believe you cannot privately jettison into the sky just for fun you must stack stories from the foundation up from the sad heart and the feet tired of supporting it language is architecture after all not an air capsule not a hang glide this is real life so dont invite anyone to a house that hasnt been built because no one unbuilds meticulously and meticulosity is what allows hearing three million richards make one point i hear it in order to make others mistake as it turns out there is a wrong way to tell this story i was wrong to tell you how muti true everything is when it would be truer to say nothing ive invented so much and prevented more but id like to talk with you about other things in absolute quiet in extreme context to see you again isnt love revision it could have gone so many ways this just one of the ways it went tell me another my own dear love he is strong and bold and he cares not what comes after his words ring sweet as a chime of gold and his eyes are lit with laughter he is jubilant as a flag unfurled oh a girl shed not forget him my own dear love he is all my world and i wish id never met him my love hes mad and my love hes fleet and a wild young wood thing bore him the ways are fair to his roaming feet and the skies are sunlit for him as sharply sweet to my heart he seems as the fragrance of acacia my own dear love he is all my dreams and i wish he were in asia my love runs by like a day in june and he makes no friends of sorrows hell tread his galloping rigadoon in the pathway of the morrows hell live his days where the sunbeams start nor could storm or wind uproot him my own dear love he is all my heart and i wish somebodyd shoot him up or out here a problem of preposition my uneasy relationwith the world whether imabove it or apart on the other sideof the latched glass door a manloves me worries calls my name where for art thou sands of windows go darkin slow succession on essexand ludlow and orchard a thousand times goodnight a boy throwing stones at a window right window wrong boy love goes toward love and the place death down therewaving its white kerchief she said she sang very close to the miketo change the space and i changed the spaceby striding down the boulevard raspail at dusk in tight jeansuntil an algerian engineer plucked the pen from my back pocket as if youre inside my head and youre hearing the song from in there he came from the desert i camefrom green suburbs we

his roomwas dim and narrow and no the story didnt slide that way though there are many waysto throw oneself away one singer did it by living by a broken walluntil she shredded her voice but still she offered each song she said like an appalachian artifact like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quayplastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dollsthrough which the current chortles an intimate tune beloved beauty who inspires love in me from afar your face obscured except when your celestial image stirs my heart in sleep or in the fields where light and natures laughter shine more lovely was it maybe you who blessed the innocent age called golden and do you now blithe spirit fly among men or does that miser fate who hides you from us save you for the future no hope of seeing you alive remains for me now except when naked and alone my soul will go down a new street to its unknown home already at the dawn of my dark uncertain day i imagined you a fellow traveler on this arid ground but theres no thing that resembles you on earth and if someone had a face like yours in act and word shed be though something like you far less beautiful in spite of all the suffering fate decreed for human time if there were anyone on earth who truly loved you as my thought depicts you this life for him would be a blessing and i see clearly how your love would lead me still to strive for praise and virtue as i used to in my early years though heaven gave no comfort for our troubles yet with you mortal life would be like what in heaven leads to divinity in the valleys where the song of the weary farmer sounds and when i sit and mourn the illusions of youth fading and on the hills where i recall and grieve for my lost desires and my lifes lost hope i think of you and start to shake if only i in this sad age and unhealthy atmosphere could keep hold of your noble look for since the real things missing i must make do with the image whether you are the only one of the eternal ideas eternal wisdom refuses to see arrayed in sensible form to know the pains of mortal life in transitory spoils or if in the supernal spheres another earth from among unnumbered worlds receives you and a near star lovelier than the sun warms you and you breathe benigner ether from here where years are both ill starred and brief accept this hymn from your unnoticed lover my sister my sweet sister if a name dearer and purer were it should be thine mountains and seas divide us but i claim no tears but tenderness to answer mine go where i will to me thou art the same a lovd regret which i would not resign there yet are two things in my destiny a world to roam through and a home with thee the first were nothing had i still the last it were the haven of my happiness but other claims and other ties thou hast and mine is not the wish to make them less a strange doom is thy fathers sons and past recalling as it lies beyond redress reversd for him our grandsires fate of yore he had no rest at sea nor i on shore if my inheritance of storms hath been in other elements and on the rocks of perils overlookd or unforeseen i have sustaind my share of worldly shocks the fault was mine nor do i seek to screen my errors with defensive paradox i have been cunning in mine overthrow the careful pilot of my proper woe mine were my faults and mine be their reward my whole life was a contest since the day that gave me being gave me that which marrd the gift a fate or will that walkd astray and i at times have found the struggle hard and thought of shaking off my bonds of clay but now i fain would for a time survive if but to see what next can well arrive kingdoms and empires in my little day i have outlivd and yet i am not old and when i look on this the petty spray of my own years of trouble which have rolld like a wild bay of breakers melts away something i know not what does still uphold a spirit of slight patience not in vain even for its own sake do we purchase pain perhaps the workings of defiance stir within me or perhaps a cold despair brought on when ills habitually recur perhaps a kinder clime or purer air for even to this may change of soul refer and with light armour we may learn to bear have taught me a strange quiet which was not the chief companion of a calmer lot i feel almost at times as i have felt in happy childhood trees and flowers and brooks which do remember me of where i dwelt ere my young mind was sacrificd to books come as of yore upon me and can melt my heart with recognition of their looks and even at moments i could think i see some living thing to love but none like thee here are the alpine landscapes which create a fund for contemplation to admire is a brief feeling of a trivial date but something worthier do such scenes inspire here to be lonely is not desolate for much i view which i could most desire and above all a lake i can behold lovelier not dearer than our own of old oh that thou wert but with me but i grow the fool of my own wishes and forget the solitude which i have vaunted so has lost its praise in this but one regret there may be others which i less may show i am not of the plaintive mood and yet i feel an ebb in my philosophy and the tide rising in my alterd eye i did remind thee of our own dear lake by the old hall which may be mine no more lemans is fair but think not i forsake the sweet remembrance of a dearer shore sad havoc time must with my memory make ere that or thou can fade these eyes before though like all things which i have lovd they are resignd for ever or divided far the world is all before me i but ask of nature that with which she will comply it is but in her summers sun to bask to mingle with the quiet of her sky to see her gentle face without a mask and never gaze on it with apathy she was my early friend and now shall be my sister till i look again on thee i can reduce all feelings but this one and that i would not for at length i see such scenes as those wherein my life begun the earliest even the only paths for me had i but sooner learnt the crowd to shun i had been better than i now can be the passions which have torn me would have slept i had not sufferd and thou hadst not wept with false ambition what had i to do little with love and least of all with fame and yet they came unsought and with me grew and made me all which they can make a name yet this was not the end i did pursue surely i once beheld a nobler aim but all is over i am one the more to baffled millions which have gone before and for the future this worlds future may from me demand but little of my care i have outlivd myself by many a day having survivd so many things that were my years have been no slumber but the prey of ceaseless vigils for i had the share of life which might have filld a century before its fourth in time had passd me by and for the remnant which may be to come i am content and for the past i feel not thankless for within the crowded sum of struggles happiness at times would steal and for the present i would not benumb my feelings further nor shall i conceal that with all this i still can look around and worship nature with a thought profound for thee my own sweet sister in thy heart i know myself secure as thou in mine we were and are i am even as thou art beings who neer each other can resign it is the same together or apart from lifes commencement to its slow decline we are entwind let death come slow or fast the tie which bound the first endures the last afloat between your lens and your gaze the last consideration to go across my gray matter and its salubrious deliquescence is whether or not ill swim whether ill be able to breathe whether ill live like before im caught in the bubble of your breath it locks me in drives me mad confined to speak alone i talk and listen ask questions and answer myself i hum i think i sing i breathe in breathe in and dont explode im no one behind the wall of hydrogen and oxygen very clear almost illuminated you allow me to think that the root of the wind is water and the atmosphere smells of salt and microbes and intimacy and in that instant comes the low echo of a beyond beyond a language archaic and soaked in syllables and accents suited for re de trans forming giving light giving birth to melanin hidden within another skin the hollow echo of the voice which speaks alone i love me sweet with all thou art feeling thinking seeing love me in the lightest part love me in full being ii love me with thine open youth in its frank surrender with the vowing of thy mouth with its silence tender iii love me with thine azure eyes made for earnest granting taking colour from the skies can heavens truth be wanting iv love me with their lids that fall snow like at first meeting love me

of change he goes to see what suns can make from soil more indurateindurate hardened and strange he cuts what holds his days together and shuts him in as lock on lock the arrowed vane announcing weather the tripping rackettripping racket either a paradox light and easy din or light and easy motion as of a dance of a clock seeking i think a light that waits still as a lamp upon a shelf a land with hills like rocky gates where no sea leaps upon itself but he will find that nothing dares to be enduring save where south of hidden deserts torn fire glares on beauty with a rusted mouth where something dreadful and another look quietly upon each other the surfers beautiful as men can be ride the warm blue green swells and the white sand is alive with girls outriggers double boats ride the waves back in as the native warriors did i tried to swim and tried to look but ended up just going back a huge perfect black man at the beach somehow drove me away a block to st augustines church the bodies were giv ing me a fit and i have come to seek the momentary calm we find sometimes in the musk of christ when he was awake and sweat ing blood as others slept or like a furious bouncer hustling out the money changers the bodies of mary and christ both still live were told theyre alive and thus must have dealt with the stress of that long time of turning on to being young i speak of teens fifteen and ten years ago when i first confessed it was in this same church built then as a gigantic shed where the strange hawaiian birds i forgot their names no matter flew in and out of the high wood en rafters like the whimsical winds of grace and grace gives back to sight what beauty is as that loveliness at the beach now the church has been rebuilt in pointed stone across the street from a much higher new hotel where at lunch i almost spilled and found i could not eat the purple orchid in my drink this was gruesome fighting over a ham sandwich with one of the tiny cats of rome he leaped on my arm and half hung on to the food and half hung on my shirt and coat i tore it apart and let him have his portion i think i lifted him down sandwich and all on the sidewalk and sat with my own sandwich beside him maybe i petted his bony head and felt him shiver i have told this story over and over some things root in the mind his boldness of course was frightening and unexpected his stubbornness though hunger drove him mad it was the breaking of boundaries the sudden invasion but not only that it was the sharing of food and the sharing of space he didnt run into an alley or into a cellar he sat beside me eating and i didnt run into a trattoria say shaking with food on my lips and blood on my cheek sobbing but not only that i had gone there to eat and wait for someone i had maybe an hour before she would come and i was full of hope and excitement i have resisted for years interpreting this but now i think i was given a clue or i was giving myself a clue across the street from the glass sandwich shop that was my last night with her the next day i would leave on the train for paris and she would meet her husband thirty five years ago i ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms we were dying together we never met again although she was pregnant when i left her i have a daughter or son somewhere darling grandchildren in norwich connecticut or canton ohio every five years i think about her again and plan on looking her up the last time i was sitting in new brunswick new jersey and heard that her husband was teaching at princeton if she was still married or still alive and tried calling i went that far we lived in florence and rome we rowed in the bay of naples and floated naked on the boards i started to think of her again today i still am horrified by that cats hunger i still am puzzled by the connection this is another insane devotion there must be hundreds although it isnt just that there is no pain and the thought is fleeting and sweet i think its my own dumb boyhood walking around with slavic cheeks and burning stupid eyes i think i gave the cat half of my sandwich to buy my life i think i broke it in half as a decent sacrifice it was this i bought the red coleus the split rocking chair the silk lampshade happiness i watched him with pleasure i bought memory i could have lost it how crazy it sounds his face twisted with cunning the wind blowing through his hair his jaws working love has gone and left me and the days are all alike eat i must and sleep i will and would that night were here but ah to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike would that it were day again with twilight near love has gone and left me and i dont know what to do this or that or what you will is all the same to me but all the things that i begin i leave before im through theres little use in anything as far as i can see love has gone and left me and the neighbors knock and borrow and life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse and to morrow and to morrow and to morrow and to morrow theres this little street and this little house who knows why my baby left me who knows where she could have gone is she hiding in the center of some little known downtown has she been seduced by villains have they got her gagged and bound vanished from the lost and found with no trace and no reminder yeah shes lost but i will find her down in the faraway suburbs puerto rico in guaynabo and tao baja the theorists and professors are playing rhetorical poker with their identity cards they are shooting wads of wisdom to impress the senile deans meanwhile the good citizens are all working for the government cheating on taxes and spouses down in the faraway suburbs new york the greyhound wheezes its way from new york up to poughkeepsie i pass the time singing gypsy by fleetwood mac a cappella and the watercolor landscape falls apart on the gray planes the diners and the dead ends the deserted factories and the doors creak noisily down in the faraway suburbs the are prehistoric skeletons at the beach on staten island and the jellyfish are dancing slow hydrochloric waltzes there are doric style chalets with south american servants where the little brothers play sniffing underarms and solvents while the dog shows off its teeth down in the faraway suburbs here the end of the expressway gives way to medieval forests and correctional facilities and mcdonalds without tourists im overwhelmed by the view of the mansions on the plains the housing projects the flames creeping through the dead of winter as the landfill burns tonight down in the faraway suburbs california in the righteous neighborhoods atherton west palo alto theyre paving over the asphalt with the gravel of privilege all ones hears are the arpeggios of the pre recorded pianos and the trembling of the hands that are serving themselves gin and the shot glass shattering down in the faraway suburbs far from all the shantytowns in millbrae and redwood city one more neighborhood committee is creating civic centers and more monumental malls catering to healthy pleasures peewee softball in the summers window shopping cineplex and those fruity tex mex shakes down in the faraway suburbs a distant majestic sun licks the cliffs and the embankments i search for your embalmed eye on the coast of the pacific marin county in particular has its share of urban ghosts like those midget saxophonists who long for their days of glory and are now telling their story down in the faraway suburbs ive searched for you in each corner of this innocuous continent could it be youre facing me could it be that youre my neighbor that the downtown and the eye balm and the grime that coats your hands are all arcane holograms that your epileptic smile died that antiseptic night down in the faraway suburbs to me fair friend you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i eyed such seems your beauty still three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes burned since first i saw you fresh which yet are green ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand steal from his figure and no pace perceived so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand hath motion and mine eye may be deceived for fear of which hear this thou age unbred ere you were born was beautys summer dead it is hard going to the door cut so small in the wall where the vision which echoes loneliness brings a scent of wild flowers in a wood what i understood i understand my mind is sometime torment sometimes good and filled with livelihood and feels the ground but i see the door and knew the wall and wanted the wood and would get there if i could with my feet and hands and mind lady do not banish me for digressions my nature is a quagmire of unresolved confessions lady i follow i walked away from myself i left the room i found the garden i knew the woman in it together we lay down dead night remembers in december we change not multiplied but dispersed sneaked out of childhood the ritual of dismemberment mighty magic is a mother in her there is another issue of fixture repeated form the race renewal the charge of the command the garden echoes across the room it is fixed in the wall like a mirror that faces a window behind you and reflects the shadows may i go now am i allowed to bow myself down in the ridiculous posture of renewal of the insistence of which i am the virtue nothing for you is untoward inside you would also be tall more tall more beautiful come toward me from the wall i want to be with you so i screamed to you who hears as the wind and changes multiply invariably changes in the mind running to the door i ran down as a clock runs down walked backwards stumbled sat down hard on the floor near the wall where were you how absurd how vicious there is nothing to do but get up my knees were iron i rusted in worship of you for that one sings one writes the spring poem one goes on walking the lady has always moved to the next town and you stumble on after her the door in the wall leads to the garden where in the sunlight sit the graces in long victorian dresses of which my grandmother had spoken history sings in their faces they are young they are obtainable and you follow after them also in the service of god and truth but the lady is indefinable she will be the door in the wall to the garden in sunlight i will go on talking forever i will never get there oh lady remember me who in your service grows older not wiser no more than before how can i die alone where will i be then who am now alone what groans so pathetically in this room where i am alone i will go to the garden i will be a romantic i will sell myself in hell in heaven also i will be in my mind i see the door i see the sunlight before me across the floor beckon to me as the ladys skirt moves small beyond it when i think of that roomi see the de kooning at the end of the hallsometimes rain on the long windowsor the tinkering of drops on the skylightbut not yvonsplashing scotch into a cocktail glassotherwise fastidious in retrospecti should have asked her moreabout the famous jazz guitaristshe had been engaged tobut that much was true even after she bought me a pocket knifesheathed in velvet every young man needs a knifeshe informed her groupbut in the restaurant her friendseyed me like a turnip one that talked while she was away at her office i tried to readher unfinished essayon the vagaries of diplomacyreclining on a rug of embroidered storksthe two small rodinsseemed misplaceda grand pianoshe didnt play though i did affecting a controlledpassionwhile gazing over rooftopsat carefully maintained gardens i dont remember her smelli dont recall her fingersthe last i heard she was living in barcelonashe never did learn to cooknow her letters are worth money marriage on earth seems such a counterfeit mere imitation of the inimitable in heaven we have the real and true and sure tis there they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels right oh how right that is how like jesus christ to say that marriage making for the earth with gold so much birth power repute so much or beauty youth so much in lack of these be as the angels rather who apart know themselves into one are found at length married but marry never no nor give in marriage they are man and wife at once when the true time is here we have to wait not so long neither could we by a wish have what we will and get the future now would we wish aught done undone in the past so let him wait gods instant men call years meantime hold hard by truth and his great soul do out the duty through such souls alone god stooping shows sufficient of his light for us i the dark to rise by and i rise you jerk you didnt call me up i havent seen you in so long you probably have a fucking tan besides that instead of making love tonight youre drinking your parents to the airport im through with you bourgeois boys all you ever do is go back to ancestral comforts only money can get even catullus was rich but nowadays you guys settle for a couch by a soporific color cable t v set instead of any arc of love no wonder the g i joe team blows it every other time wake up its the middle of the night you can either make love or die at the hands of the cobra commander to make love turn to page to die turn to page on the phonograph the voice of a woman already dead for three decades singing of a man who could make her do anything on the table two fragile glasses of black wine a bottle wrapped in its towel it is that room the one we took in every city it is as i remember the bed a block of moonlight and pillows my fingernails pecks of light on your thighs the stink of the fire escape the wet butts of cigarettes you crushed one after another how i watched the morning come as you slept more my son than a man ten years older how my breasts feel years later the tongues swishing in my dress some yours some left by other men since then i have always wakened first i have learned to leave a bed without being seen and have stood at the washbasins wiping oil and salt from my skin staring at the cupped water in my two hands i have kept everything you whispered to me then i can remember it now as i see you again how much tenderness we could wedge between a stairwell and a police lock or as it was as it still is in the voice of a woman singing of a man who could make her do anything when nature made her chief work stellas eyes in colour black why wrapt she beams so bright would she in beamy black like painter wise frame daintiest lustre mixd of shades and light or did she else that sober hue devise in object best to knit and strength our sight lest if no veil these brave gleams did disguise they sunlike should more dazzle than delight or would she her miraculous power show that whereas black seems beautys contrary she even in black doth make all beauties flow both so and thus she minding love should be placd ever there gave him this mourning weed to honour all their deaths who for her bleed i tripartite schemes were all very well for the builders who held their blueprints firmly in hand beforehand what did it matter if the two vertical poles didnt touch seemed so far apart in fact that no one who visited the site could believe the architects arrogant babble before they knew it hed bridged the two poles with a plank i have hidden under these structures of synthetic comfort when the sky was overcast i have even hired a claque of unemployed actors to stand there with me but speaking for myself i find their tentlike charm diminishing over on the next hill is a line of poker faced upright slabs their bases deep in the dirt their function something else entirely ii i keep seeking this pleasure giving eye mote you fill your pew and my view with golden uncontrollable emanation and the music surges in response a coded story of hope and disappointment decipherable to the few is it wrong to be overheated here or not to have left my coat at the entrance the only crime would be not to swoon to see and ignore you or brand you a brother in spotless devotion beneath the bleeding windows hearts must have heft masses of skin become human tremors to feel the force of the organ on its own the rite is a starchy obligation add intrigue and the altar ripples and ripples iii over the hub of the hill a solid wall of silver leaves underfoot soil without burrows blanketing soil and leaves a scrim of hushed and unpunctured blue then all of a sudden rumors of something about to happen the night restless with its own unkeepable secrets the very air strained and achingly electric because you are not here nighttime behaves this way calling for terms id long since put away susurration intrigue reverberant it is only in your magnanimous absence that stony surroundings can sing your praises so i curse even as i gape to know that their raving requires your being anywhere else the evening hums in compensation iv his beak is open as if in mid worm or mid sentence his feet impressively sturdy as they straddle the street what gives him away though is the magenta pool spreading rapidly under this otherwise unruffled stomach something ended this bird so suddenly that he never had time to strike a normal death pose it would be overdone and untrue to say i am the bird to paint myself in similar terms as stunted irretrievably downed forever rooted to unkind ground it would smack of self pity we are partners instead beneath a general rubric of doom an arrow descended and brought him startled to death me screamingly to life v i loved a statue and watered it daily sooner or later it softened and let me break a vital part of it off with my hard won prize in my pocket i explored the streets with a secret but before long the plundered piece was dust in my hands and painful to look at now another effigy makes me shudder at its criminal threshold more than ever i entertain a shameless urge to steal or caress it but the facts of history tell me otherwise you get what you pray for and the statue dwindles to rubble vi although others lack the sharpened knives to be villains they do what they can with blunter instruments sparring to kill time falling to fisticuffs when eloquence evades them they get their days entertainment from instruction manuals bought at auctions when one utters his bored touch a gaggle of fans surround him how much deadlier is your collection of swords with a history scimitars that glint even when strung up and inactive although i would gladly lay a whetstone at your door for one blinding night of thrust and parry you have no need of anything resembling aid one twist of your weapon outstabs the meanest ranks of dullard soldiers vii the avuncular figure with grizzled beard the bearer of balm for the stricken and abandoned the craggy but spirited sickle carrier paces the page of a long forgotten book of days and never once frowns there is no need to our days may be numbered but and here his eyes mist over with comforting thoughts of gold and rainbows his evil twin wants none of this waiting this starry eyed torpor hoping to scare eternity into submission he too brandishes a sickle but everything goes wrong he pierces his own leg and must go on crutches before long he falls into childish fits of self pity proffering sickle and leg to hirelings saying lop it off boys and be quick viii during the first stages of frenzy a glut of meaning descends on nature as if to spite cynics who call dirt nothing but dirt terrific breezes mere conveyors of pollen something in the sufferers mind seeks out and finds corroboration in vast planets and puny insects all are as prone to nervous tics all whirring with badly kept secrets time passes and the system turn on you when all is sacred nothing is safe silent lampposts suddenly pipe up in irresistible colloquy a tone too high the sky calls you but does not want your replies and water bound birds decline pronouns in latin it is a hotbed that cannot stand the addition of an offending presence it whispers until you are well on your way ix before you came on the scene and blasted the image to bits i thought of love as a spacious courtroom where evidence was presented graphically and up front where deserving plaintiffs got what they wanted legally and where judges beamed beneath picturesque wigs when they saw happy verdicts amicably arrived at these days law is something to be left at the door along with galoshes i spend my nights in sinister mock trial playing all the parts guilty or not booms our pot bellied exquisitely bored judge i answer for you not your holiness this harridan framed me and then i object and then hunched over in a corner of the courtroom a juror suggests we all go out to lunch x it was a run of the mill journey until the windows seemed to have melted outside the train the foliage of early summer received an instantaneous drenching startled i thought of you like a lovesick heroine out of an old romance holding her heart agawp at natures rages she would watch the storm from inside and secretly like it no longer dainty hand to the head the tragic meaningful stare out the window no storm buffets alone however stunningly leaves may shudder and press against the pane it is a wasted downpour if nobody comes out soggy reaching my stop i left my cap and trenchcoat inside a locker and headed for the wet jungle hot on your heels xi our meeting is as stiff as a long dead thoroughbred like its former coat we too are glossy and brief no frizzy wire springs up that is not dutifully cropped our every neigh is strictly by the book place us in a lineup of similarly frozen stallions and you will not know one rigor mortis from another and another i could endure a salvo of kicking a brutish uprearing nag or a vicious race to the finish over this wingless duo of moribund mares i could even stand it if you leapt up and started poking holes in my horse metaphor anything other than the way our speech resembles the two extremes of stunted growth gorgeous stillborns cynical has beens this is no time for pleasantry xii i have been dreaming you into the picture when you bound unseeing past me i tingle onward with knees of jelly glad to be confirmed in my scheming this walk is no hopeless ramble but a perfect way of seeing and being seen fate sensing my hopes obligingly guides you outdoors what rankles is the time it takes me to realize that you are truly tangibly here i have been holding so many secret meetings with you that this brief encounter this perfect opportunity passes doesnt register i see you in retrospect you were here jacket flapping in the noon breeze and gone by the time i had presence of mind to grasp it xiii explaining camouflage a useful way of suiting yourself to your habitat so that you steal its features more than it steals yours in war a surefire method of avoiding skirmishes in love a vanishing act that lets you watch the object of your affection in whose vagrant eyes you might as well be a pebble a flaw on the leaf or a ruinous self effacement brainchild of the timid deserving to be trounced by the rustle in the trees which announces a vital presence the force which storming a fortress subjects its tenant to a scrutiny of his most cherished beliefs the stunning hybrid you look at once and cannot get out of your mind xiv hearing you praised is enough to make my overbaked brain a warpath for feuding goddesses only instead of swords their messages clash each one a model of what i might do on one side silence stately in black shows no sign of unrest her only response to the beaming crowd is to nod on the other side in see through red a goddess named outrage deafens her rival with laudatory overdrive next to her encomia both clean and unclean the excesses of the laurel throwers positively began to pale it is her manner that somehow filters out the walls start to rumble the floorboards feeble at keeping secrets murmur swear it xv in the handed down inventory of loves habits we find images of lowering down at the mouth down on the knees prostrate with the shock of the marvelous contact more than shame faced with the elevated figure is therefore impossible hazard more than a bow and a trapdoor opens beneath you offer a hand and see love disappear there is never a mention of the sudden boost the run down ego receives when flinging a jest from toad high levels it witnesses more than haughty approval nor is it told how the jest some minor impromptu line gets told and retold in the prolonged wake of the moment seraphs laugh at it trees love it you see your dullness shine in anothers eyes xvi a dream straight out of a textbook having been tied up and pointed at the wall by a swarthy hairy faced thug and her henchman i hear the incredible shouts as an old babysitter is disemboweled severed organs flap to the floor like pancakes but i do not think me next fearing instead that it will fall on me to clean up the horrible mess what can i do on waking but clench my stomach in sharp instinctive need to keep it closed in wars between the hirsute and the nurturing nobody dares to cheer for the former though her company being moody is hellishly more alive will this day or the next bring pearly surfaces to the brink of spilling over somewhere the babysitter screams your name xvii once a day you report to the resident loony for clues leading to the whereabouts of the author of a love letter you have received she is mad but useful delving as she can into alternate worlds and as you grill her from the other side of the bars a strange bond begins to form between you she seems to have felt as you do little do you know that this sibyl is also a relentless self promoter she ladles out counsel you can tell she wants to be tracked down and misinformation i think i know where she lives like a watery broth that keeps you coming back for the meaty pay off at the bottom all this you realize and tolerate never suspecting that shes the one you want xviii when you are within shouting distance it is no matter or next to none what you say or whether we speak at all it is enough to see and covertly to love your bright array of colorful traits they are no sooner parceled out than stored up secret accounts to be gone over until the whole single spaced ledger is memorized but when you leave ledgers cannot contain you time passes and the beloved blurs the riotous gestures faded in substance though not in force i cannot hear your voice if i try and what do i do when a free floating affection outraces its visible target from your splendid outpost that dazzles merely by being yours send photos xix abroad you are a mass of extra shadow falling on all you see on its own a square is stiff and formidable walk in it and the arches tremble the smells from the canal soften and linger the red of the hills at evening is fit for a postcard home until you step in the picture and hand it back to the masters it is straight out of a shoddy french novel to squeeze the continents into us them categories and chapters mold here fruit there stubble in places and wheat in others think me less a philistine when i say how little the steps of the journey frame you it is you torchbearer to shrouded lands who flood them with living color xx when i call you to mind you respond sluggishly if at all it is as if being busy you send a very expensive mannequin in your stead a robot who dresses and walks like you but cannot capture your puzzling essence memory loves paradox the more i require a stand in the looser the seams the phonier the puppet but i do not know this until the unexpected happens sifting my horde of jewels and praising their cut i come upon a diamond that puts them to shame catching a glimpse of familiar patterns of color in the street i realize the cheapness of the household dolls i have been thinking about relieved that even now surprises like this put you fleetingly back in the picture xxi it will be objected that in missing you i forfeit a key to the room reserved for bona fide lovers there an air of resolute calm prevails it is always our minds are as one and that is enough or i saw him last night in the shape of a cloud or harder still to believe look at the useful machine i built instead of grieving they may brace themselves and speak of the salubrious sublime they may grit their teeth and bear it their tourniqueted hearts are as undone as mine away you are no homing compass or dove but a roving ceaselessly altering scoundrel to miss you is to miss the loot you add to your repository of noises xxii horses birds babysitters and jails shadows churches and trains one would think youd sat up with me all night filling out forms on what images you preferred or at least been consulted in the matter failing that one might suppose you to have stood on the sidelines in mounting horror as one by one strange pictures of you took flight but you stumbled into this mess of blocks like the bumbling idiot in a screwball comedy center stage contained in cardboard boxes you tripped over before smiling and wandering on in your madcap way to new scrapes meanwhile the whirligig thrives in your absence booted cubes swoon for their muse a poltergeist in a bowtie xxiii a spider loved a bee and knowing that to trap him would be to kill him devised webs just flashy enough to keep the insect guessing and soon seeing in the spiders handiwork traces of his own flower hopping the bee came closer arachnid vapors wafted over them as the bee proposed to die in the spiders service no screamed the latter tightening up her floss and the spurned bee flew on to more accustomed turf roses and lilies next to whom he saw the spider was nothing but she was not so lucky the web shed spun for him got tangled in her post mortem antenna flailing and finally wound around her neck and choked her it was the end of the fable xxiv the more love grows the bigger its sealed off palace becomes and the more pinched and dark its stoical keeper inside sun breeds space a ray that snuck past the keeper enters a room and lights it only now there is not one room but many beams bright as lasers but gentler give away the safe behind the painting the corridor under the rug if only the keeper hardened by circumstance could learn from this endless illumination and turn the room inside out light would then seep through leathery skin giving its secrets away in a gradually spreading glow turning skin the orange of pure beatitude but there are only two options for the keeper to be charbroiled all at once or eternally silent xxv then any enterprise requiring new clothes was privately hissed if openly hailed too close to a floral militia thinking as one were the standard frills the required rustles and thinking myself a beacon among dark ladies i called the clothes by their hidden agendas ethical corsets trusses of the spirit now i cry out for the colorful front of fancy dress bow down in belated awe before silk and organza it is not the delusion of being at my best but the promise of further secrecy that thrills me these veils only make unveiling all the stranger and wilder and under my gown claw ghosts youll never see xxvi this sideshow of outlandish images is nothing like the main attractions of another time just after one picture clicks on and the eyes have adjusted another altogether different one takes its place and another and another what in the world is going on did the projector gather together the uppermost slides on the pile nothing could be falser it is only that the replacement of the reel calls for as many tricks and turns as possible to be an even passable substitute everything is its field its lens is a gaping hole with a passion for things encyclopedic this is the only way it can capture your many angles small comfort yet comfort still xxvii the next time our paths cross there will be none of this shilly shallying this bondage like it or not to fickle time brute locale the crossing itself will slow down the march of the passing moment with its own unstoppable steam its tenebrous and sultry collection of vapors it will be love in a bottle but there is always a screw loose somewhere a gap in the glass that lets in a limber array of interlopers from the mutual friend who smells a levity and wants in to the premature bonging of the hour to the false confines of the walls of our houses there is always a damnable flaw in the system and incoming elves who taunt excuses excuses xxviii what is it about this flame i label passion that burns the world and its newspapers to a crisp how can i call myself hungry for the facts of one kind but wince at another the lovers room may be an all white tiny room with a view of woods but why if a well meaning friend slides a special report under my door do i look for tongs and a furnace because the flame is not only self infatuated given to burning documents for the sake of flaunting its own reds but also in a state of permanent warfare all worldly flare ups all currencies not its own remind it that amid the worst incendiary horrors it goes on stoking itself for want of a proper spark xxix the catechism of the far gone isnt it too good to be coincidental that our eyes have looked at that billboard with the same unqualified disgust can we ignore the fact that you happened to witness the accident only minutes after i did is there more than just a flimsy link in a story jointly loved a pastime avoided no yes and by no means these are the very traits which observed in an enemy get shelved or denied by their once proud possessor i could pillage an igloo travel to the torrid antipodes and produce thousands like you featured like you like you in raves and complaints i was bedazzled by a ray of fools gold xxx go tyrant in your heart will nest no more desperate slaves come again days of productivity nights of rest and no nightmares i have spent so much time under the shade of your massive umbrella that i will draw it shut for a minute to see what i once saw and what i have missed since seeing you eyes look unchained around you it is a landscape of moldering stones and bones when the eyes are free to roam they are not so much free as useless i see a sky of fledgling clouds and do nothing to help them peer into the living record of a severed oak and can decipher nothing return dark glasses come again morbid parasol only in shade do mountains have features xxxi in the final tally of divine overseers who will be ours suppose we claim the moon whose bottomless bag of stardust enchants a forest of two softens and shrinks the volume of venomous air between us and lovingly coats all former fears with beams of forgetful nourishing light our watcher is the moon but only after a brutal shake up is through with her she has never learned the knack of lighting two people at once instead it is always me illumined you off in the bushes you posed in your halo me waist deep in darkness and she is a clumsy goddess for the reason that she borrows poor moon what light she has from me xxxii though you are by definition a slippery freedom if forced to freeze you in a single image i would call you a beam of light with hidden powers to strike and alter forever here is a room regard its monotone grimness enter your incandescent highness gladly around you objects sparkle knowing a beam when they see it next to your flawless arc i am a damaged bulb in a fleabag hotel clattering on to reveal paintings on velvet and objets trouv s but where rattling off to plunge the run down room into dark desuetude what if we pooled our forces would we stand together like heartless neon sculpture or deck ourselves in loving chiaroscuro xxxiii perfect you say it is enough to make me perform operations on myself in order to test your love taking in the wreckage you would be forced to say yes gouging out one eye makes the other shine all the brighter the smell of your fungus reminds me of summer your leprous stump is a modish charmer since after all green is my favorite color and yet for all our tirades against deception how easily do we succumb to the lovers flattery and with what treachery if i am perfect it is only by being perfect that you myopic dependable you can keep me so go on keep on calling me faultless come on hurry up with my supper leave me and come back at midnight but dont come back if you hear a noise in the room xxxiv still the inveterate skulker the ghost of chaos past i have come back to the place where it all began where leaving you gave me leave to see you wherever i went in the home in the wild in the sky in the gutter and where columns scribbled on and abandoned took one look at my raving and rose again strangest of all is that given the chance to see my subject in the fabulous flesh at last i would flatly refuse these barren days when i heat my room by the fading coals of my goals this ache for an ache is as good as it gets so go on running i will go on looking for you as the willow bends as the stomach hunts for the ulcer and if every step taken is a step well lived but a foot towards death every pilgrimage a circle every flight path the tracing of a sphere i will give myself over and over i have migrated through carpathians of sorrow to myself heaped happy in the corner there nothing seemed strange in the world youll understand nothing ever more would monkey boy came to me saying look the moon of the moon the little one circled the big one he crouched in the palm of my hand tiny sincere pointing at the sky there was something sad about him the python was nothing nothing at all nothing but strength shed to suppleness nothing but will encased in itself the python was a muscle of thought coiled and mute in a place where nothing but rain fell the python thought this is the beginning or end of the world the python was everywhere everywhere at once aware only too much of that ageless agony its existence i am tired it said and the stream burbled by i am waiting for the recoil the uncoil coil of night coil of stars coil of the coldness of the water the python said who are these people the whole city sweated moved like a limb the air fitted like a glove two sizes too small and too many singers sang the banal the bars roared all night the kite hawks grew ashamed all nature squirmed in the yellow time of pollen theres a certain slant of light that devours the afternoon and you would wait forever at the gare de lest if time stood still if she would come she is the leopard then its silvery speed where will you wrestle her and in what shadows and on what crumpled sheets and all those sheets were pampas and savannas the soft expanses of all that would be absent forever all that was past and future and not here and in a white rose there were not to be found any secrets since in its unfolding there was no centre nor in its decay only the random petals fallen in the yellow time of poppies when the fields were ablaze those invisible pollens rained around us the days held us lightlocked in golden surrender and all night long the night shot stars when my chest unconstricted at last did yours the real issue of course was this atomically energetically everything was wave function and a wave continues forever into space the wavelength never alters only the intensity lessens so in the worst cosmic way everything is connected by vibrations and this as even a dog would know is no consolation ah but the dogs will save us all in the end even the planet not the superdogs but the household friendlies always eager to please hysterically fond incessant carrying in the very wagging of their tales an unbounded love not even therapists could imagine their forgiveness unhinges us we were reduced to this this day and night primary gold and indigo the binary profusion of distances guessed at heat and cold colours logged in the retina and lodged in the spine we were dogs who knew the infinite is now that celandine was buttercup that buttercup was marigold the dog star marked the dog days and the wild rose was dog rose the crows foot was wild hyacinth by day the correspondences were clear i walked across the whin land speedwell bluer than sky a practised ear could hear between two breaths deep space wherein the mind collects itself words foundered and cracked nearly never bulled the cow a shining isomorphousness rang out the roussignol sang all night all colours were shuffled endlessly but never lost a practised ear could hear between two breaths the secret blackness of the snow come flooding in on summers lawns the ice melt sprayed its figure eights from sprinklers and everything stopped working second time around as if it had never happened before fans moved the corpses of fireflies through the rooms supplicant pathetic pleading in brittle postures everything was magnified by their bug eyed deaths we became solemn in that profusion of dying cane toads fattened the asphalt in the mist and the rain our headlights caught them tensed as if listening they were waiting mute for the imbecility of eternity the clocks merely pulsed or rather the days like shotgun spray on the weatherboard sleep scattered itself through the blurred heat and secreted itself in the nooks of delirium sometimes the magpies would wake us or the phone mid afternoon and we needed nothing not even hope being no different from the dragonflies or the cows in their despair it appeared we lived on sunlight and chocolate bars you blossomed so from not ever reading the newspapers things came and went the years and all the airports i was a shade scattering my shade seed liberally to the winds and weathervanes there was not enough absence to go round i heard voices stabat mater in the whine of jets and in air vents and headphones a stream trilling over rocks on tarmacs and in transit i saw your lips your nakedness the trees that dappled light i dreamt of orchards the preciseness of the world came flooding in tird with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimmd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplacd and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgracd and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue tied by authority and folly doctor like controlling skill and simple truth miscalld simplicity and captive good attending captain ill tird with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone at length by so much importunity pressd take c at once the inside of my breast this stupid indiffrence so often you blame is not owing to nature to fear or to shame i am not as cold as a virgin in lead nor is sundays sermon so strong in my head i know but too well how time flies along that we live but few years and yet fewer are young but i hate to be cheated and never will buy long years of repentance for moments of joy oh was there a man but where shall i find good sense and good nature so equally joind would value his pleasure contribute to mine not meanly would boast nor would lewdly design not over severe yet not stupidly vain for i would have the power tho not give the pain no pedant yet learned no rake helly gay or laughing because he has nothing to say to all my whole sex obliging and free yet never be fond of any but me in public preserve the decorum thats just and shew in his eyes he is true to his trust then rarely approach and respectfully bow but not fulsomely pert nor yet foppishly low but when the long hours of public are past and we meet with champagne and a chicken at last may evry fond pleasure that moment endear be banishd afar both discretion and fear forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd he may cease to be formal and i to be proud till lost in the joy we confess that we live and he may be rude and yet i may forgive and that my delight may be solidly fixd let the friend and the lover be handsomely mixd in whose tender bosom my soul may confide whose kindness can soothe me whose counsel can guide from such a dear lover as here i describe no danger should fright me no millions should bribe but till this astonishing creature i know as i long have livd chaste i will keep myself so i never will share with the wanton coquette or be caught by a vain affectation of wit the toasters and songsters may try all their art but never shall enter the pass of my heart i loath the lewd rake the dressd fopling despise before such pursuers the nice virgin flies and as ovid has sweetly in parable told we harden like trees and like rivers grow cold her eyes the glow worm lend thee the shooting stars attend thee and the elves also whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire befriend thee no will o th wisp mis light thee nor snake or slow worm bite thee but on on thy way not making a stay since ghost theres none to affright thee let not the dark thee cumber what though the moon does slumber the stars of the night will lend thee their light like tapers clear without number then julia let me woo thee thus thus to come unto me and when i shall meet thy silvry feet my soul ill pour into thee an hourglass constricted the whore inside of me who is watching the clock monitoring the time this wasted time to get off get going lunar cycle gauge of tide and meridian how i can hear the sand slip downward in my body clock i need to be here could be there and not long ago the only place you wanted me to be was by your side maybe i am a pencil that cannot sharpen ink that slides off paper outside of our time i am lost a one ended boomerang i sit on the couch witness my life projected on a screen i am white w a chiseled dimpled chin no lips im a farmer who lives alone in a loft not a lowly office worker who lives w a roommate in an apartment where dust balls decorate the floors walls the ceiling rings w childrens feet running back forth like baby bulls i am crazy enough to be a contestant on a show where im contractually obligated to propose to a woman who believes in a heteronormative patriarchal idea of what a family should be at the end of every episode i offer roses to those i wish to make out w more take out on prepackaged romantic dates i could never afford on my bachelor budget for example a date in a castle a glass slipper prop a clock winding its way down to midnight my date i sip champagne chat eat then we dance to a live orchestra led by a maestro who wishes he were dead a giant screen appears plays a clip of a live action cinderella movie w prince charming played by an actor ive seen slaughter behead a soldier like clipping the head off a rose in real life my dates consist of dinner at burger king where we dine on chicken fries don paper crowns for a royal feel on another show date i take two women into south dakota where we fly over the heads of white slave owners carved into a sacred native mountain at the end of the date i offer no roses to either woman abandon them on a canopied bed in the middle of the badlands take off in a helicopter to provide the cameras an aerial view of wilderness despair at the end of the show i find myself proposing to a fertility nurse in a barn made to look like a chapel not the place where i raised my first horse fucked my first goat here i will milk the cows for our future offspring to drink straight from the teat like i did as a kid the show ends i rise from the couch walk into the kitchen on bended knee i reach for a bottle of beer deep in the back of the fridge pop the top like a question take a swig cold crisp once it hits my full lips awakened from a dream i curl up and turn the roses on the dresser smile and your words bloom the red roses for valentines day like in a film thoughts of you unfold moment by moment i vaguely hear the sound of your spoon scooping cereal the water stream in the shower the buzzing noise of your electric razor like a singing of cicada your footsteps in and out of the bedroom your lips touching my cheek lightly and the sound of the door shutting in your light i fall asleep again under the warm quilt happily like a child upon waking on the kitchen counter i find a half grapefruit carefully cut and sectioned such a loving touch is a milestone for my newly found happiness how were we to know leaving your two kids behind in new hampshire for our honeymoon at twenty one that it was a trick of cheap hotels in new york city to draw customers like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby arriving in our fourth floor room we found a bed a scarred bureau and a bathroom door with a cut on one side the exact shape of the toilet bowl that was in its way when i closed it i opened and shut the door admiring the fit and despairing of it you discovered the initials of lovers carved on the bureaus top in a zigzag breaking heart how wrong the place was to us then unable to see the portents of our future that seem so clear now in the naivete of the arrangements we made the hotels disdain for those with little money the carving of pain and love yet in that room we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay our love down and in this way began our unwise and persistent and lucky life together ask me no more where jove bestows when june is past the fading rose for in your beautys orient deep these flowers as in their causes sleep ask me no more whither do stray the golden atoms of the day for in pure love heaven did prepare those powders to enrich your hair ask me no more whither doth haste the nightingale when may is past for in your sweet dividing throat she winters and keeps warm her note ask me no more where those stars light that downwards fall in dead of night for in your eyes they sit and there fixed become as in their sphere ask me no more if east or west the phoenix builds her spicy nest for unto you at last she flies and in your fragrant bosom dies our fathers have formed a poetry workshop they sit in a circle of disappointment over our fastballs and wives we thought they didnt read our stuff whole anthologies of poems that begin my father never or those that end and he was silent as a carp or those with middles which if you think of the right side as a sketch look like a paunch of beer and worry but secretly with flashlights in the woods theyve read every word and noticed that our nine happy poems have balloons and sex and giraffes inside but not one dad waving hello from the top of a hill at dusk theirs is the revenge school of poetry with titles like my yellow sheet lad and given your mothers taste for vodka im pretty sure youre not mine theyre not trying to make the poems better so much as sharper or louder more like a fishhook or electrocution as a group they overcome their individual senilities their complete distaste for language how cloying it is how like tears it can be and remember every mention of their long hours at the office or how tired they were when they came home when they were dragged through the door by their shadows i dont know why its so hard to write a simple and kind poem to my father who worked not like a dog dogs sleep most of the day in a ball of wanting to chase something but like a man a man with seven kids and a house to feed whose absence was his presence his present the cheerios the pf flyers who taught me things about trees that theyre the most intricate version of standing up who built a grandfather clock with me so i would know that time is a constructed thing a passing ticking fancy a bomb a bomb thatll go off soon for him for me and i notice in our fathers poems a reciprocal dwelling on absence that they wonder why we disappeared as soon as we got our licenses why we wanted the rocket cars as if running away from them to kiss girls who looked like mirrors of our mothers wasnt fast enough and it turns out they did start to say something to form the words hey or stay but wed turned into a door full of sun into the burning leave and were gone before it came to them that it was all right to shout that they should have knocked us down with a hand on our shoulders that they too are mystified by the distance men need in their love o she says because she loves to say o o to this cloud break that ravels the night o to this moon its mouthful of sorrow o shallow grass and the nettle burrs bite o to hearts flare its wobbly satellite o step after step in stumbling tempo o owl in oak o rout of black bat flight o moaned in attic and esperanto o covetous tongue o fat fandango o gnat tango in the hot ochered light o wind whirred leaves in subtle inferno o flexing of sea o stars bolted tight o ludicrous swoon o blind hindsight o torching of bridges and blood boiled white o sparrow and arrow and hell below o she says because she loves to say o what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helens cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every bless d shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart once we played at love together played it smartly if you please lightly as a windblown feather did we stake a heart apiece oh it was delicious fooling in the hottest of the game without thought of future cooling all too quickly burned lifes flame in this give and take of glances kisses sweet as honey dews when we played with equal chances did you win or did i lose after twenty i stopped counting not like my friend beverly who sewed an embroidered satin star on her bell bottoms for every new guy she fucked she had them running down both legs and around the billowing hem and was starting up the inseam when the jeans gave out in the wash it was a boys game anyway those years of our extended homage to the penis the guitar playing the penis drums saluting it cock rock molotov cocktail the motorcycle gripped between the thighs and i went down we all went down in the old cultural disaster of idol worship a thousand year bender only this time it was the adolescent member oiled and laved thrust forward arcing thin with ache all tight flesh poked upward claiming its own how it came and went penetrating but never settling down and how often we were caused to admire it hairless sweet warrior raider against the state but i have this sweet pink flower here between my legs i put my hand down and touch it still soft and wet and many folded endlessly opening hiding seeking hidden and sought but never very much admired or even smiled on in those years never served much less sung to not a garden then but a citadel a wall to be breached a new land claimed but linger there no i would say there was an overall lack of appreciation though breasts were well respected slopping loose under t shirts like little animals and i would feel my nipples brush the cotton with pleasure see them regarded also with pleasure still sex then was a taking like spoils of war a victory over all those straight fucks back home marooned in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways and god knows it felt good those nights i was ready it was ready to open and answer the call and take me down and roll me over yes and give it to me but why all this riding away afterward where was everyone going and why didnt i get to ride along who knew at first nothing had changed just wanting the thrust and tug and slam up against the headboard i should say so but left still wanting more wanting to leap out of centuries shame and be something new not this old consolation of women for the powerless some kind of cosmic door prize awarded just for showing up with a dick some proof to themselves these boys were men youre good he said hell i wasnt taking a typing test i was fighting to live in a dying world i was throwing myself away an offering to wildest space surrender to the minds dissolve the bodys electric light nerve endings firing like exploding stars youre good they all said youd think somebody was doing a survey girls say yes to boys who say no and then your professor asks if youre wearing underwear when you meet for your conference on the poetry of yeats crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car after a visit to the after hours doctors office in sarnia nodding out in the back seat pills wearing off he was a legend among undergraduates cheap and reliable always on call until a month later the headlines screamed abortion doc when a girl died in his office and he dragged her down to the river and dumped her body in the underbrush beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groanfor that deep wound it gives my friend and me ist not enough to torture me alone but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken and my next self thou harder hast engrossed of him myself and thee i am forsaken a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard thou canst not then use rigour in my jail and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee perforce am thine and all that is in me what booth is this the last was a plastic gallows in the teach me to kiss booth you paid your dollar to promote when prompted a theory advised me about standing close and touching him who might next enter in such a way that draws contrast rough and smooth cool and warm maybe the heel of the hand and thumb at the neck if the collar is open and the fingertips two three four but never anything about the mouth and then it was time i back exited through the heavy drapes and opened shop next door what booth is this in this booth i have rescued a dovekie but it will not eat as the tub fills i need you tore your ticket right to surrender two of the goldfish from this bag ill be back in a minute the last of the sun is pinkening the ridge beyond the fairgrounds and id like to see what booth is this keep moving everyone careful of the gourds theyre pursing ive handed over the last admission i can afford into this booth the branch of a bean tree descends and in an eventuality brought on by what yet i cannot say the armlong pods burst with pellet shot pressure and release seeds like these embedded in the board behind you the next booth is one i have to man for someone an emergency ill meet you there is this even a booth in this booth there is room for one get in here and hold me up i would fall without you why are we not told plainly what good as a booth is this what booth if it be one feel the first drop as from a shearwater ocean bird held high for miles on the cyclonic air blown far inland never otherwise seen the barometer is bottoming this booth of ours is an eye of the storm simulation when i see you who were so wise and cool gazing with silly sickness on that fool youve given your love to your adoring hands touch his so intimately that each understands i know most hidden things and when i know your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow of his red lips and that the empty grace of those strong legs and arms that rosy face has beaten your heart to such a flame of love that you have given him every touch and move wrinkle and secret of you all your life oh then i know im waiting lover wife for the great time when love is at a close and all its fruits to watch the thickening nose and sweaty neck and dulling face and eye that are yours and you most surely till you die day after day youll sit with him and note the greasier tie the dingy wrinkling coat as prettiness turns to pomp and strength to fat and love love love to habit and after that when all thats fine in man is at an end and you that loved young life and clean must tend a foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old when his rare lips hang flabby and cant hold slobber and youre enduring that worst thing senilitys queasy furtive love making and searching those dear eyes for human meaning propping the bald and helpless head and cleaning a scrap that lifes flung by and loves forgotten then youll be tired and passion dead and rotten and hell be dirty dirty o lithe and free and lightfoot that the poor heart cries to see thats how ill see your man and you but you oh when that time comes youll be dirty too im here one fat cherry blossom blooming like a clod one sad groat glazing a needle puling thread so what so sue me these days what else to do but leer at any boy with just the right hairline hey i say thats one tasty piece of nature tart darkling if i could id gin id bargain id take a little troll this moolit night let you radish me awhile let you gag and confound me how much ive struggled with despicing you always your false poppets relentless distances yet plea bargaining and lack of conversation continue to make me your faithful indefile im lonely ive turned all rage to rag all pratfalls fast to fatfalls for you my farmer in the dwell so struggle strife so strew me to bell with these clucking mediocrities these anxieties over such beings thirty still smitten with this heaven never meant for never heard from youve said were each pockmarked like a golf course with what cant be said of us bred in us isnt our tasty piece of nature but i tell you ive stars ive true blue depths have learned to use the loo the crew the whole slough of pill popping devices without you your intelligent and pitiless graze everyone knows love is just a euphemism for youve failed me anyway so screw me bartering yam regardless of want im nothing without scope hope nothing without your possibility so lets laugh like the thieves we are together the sieves you my janus gate my sigmund fraud my crawling crack crazed street sprawled out revisible spell bound hello joy im thirsty im pasty rectum in your absence ive learned to fill myself with starts heres my paters heres my blue i just wanted to write again and say how much ive failed you when i consider everything that grows holds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checkd even by the selfsame sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new the world had fled with all its silly caresand questionable aches and in one swoonwe rose above its stupefying airslike flying lovesick pigs up to the moon in that blue light where two lives equaled all our souls looked down upon a spinning ball the world returned and this was a surprisei raged against like someone on a rack telling the sun tears clouding my stunned eyes give us our splendid isolation back i craved third rails a shot of something strong when i found out it doesnt last for long the world came back and stayed pain never ended but when the aches and cares begged for a hand grew softer in the light wed made and tended i finally began to understand loves widening third stage and of the three this was the most outstanding ecstasy how do we come to be here next to each other in the night where are the stars that show us to our love inevitable outside the leaves flame usual in darkness and the rain falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh the black men waiting on the corner for a womanly mirage i am amazed by peace it is this possibility of you asleep and breathing in the quiet air the rain set early in to night the sullen wind was soon awake it tore the elm tops down for spite and did its worst to vex the lake i listened with heart fit to break when glided in porphyria straight she shut the cold out and the storm and kneeled and made the cheerless grate blaze up and all the cottage warm which done she rose and from her form withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl and laid her soiled gloves by untied her hat and let the damp hair fall and last she sat down by my side and called me when no voice replied she put my arm about her waist and made her smooth white shoulder bare and all her yellow hair displaced and stooping made my cheek lie there and spread oer all her yellow hair murmuring how she loved me she too weak for all her hearts endeavour to set its struggling passion free from pride and vainer ties dissever and give herself to me for ever but passion sometimes would prevail nor could to nights gay feast restrain a sudden thought of one so pale for love of her and all in vain so she was come through wind and rain be sure i looked up at her eyes happy and proud at last i knew porphyria worshipped me surprise made my heart swell and still it grew while i debated what to do that moment she was mine mine fair perfectly pure and good i found a thing to do and all her hair in one long yellow string i wound three times her little throat around and strangled her no pain felt she i am quite sure she felt no pain as a shut bud that holds a bee i warily oped her lids again laughed the blue eyes without a stain and i untightened next the tress about her neck her cheek once more blushed bright beneath my burning kiss i propped her head up as before only this time my shoulder bore her head which droops upon it still the smiling rosy little head so glad it has its utmost will that all it scorned at once is fled and i its love am gained instead porphyrias love she guessed not how her darling one wish would be heard and thus we sit together now and all night long we have not stirred and yet god has not said a word i want to always sleep beneath a bright red blanket of leaves i want to never wear a coat of ice i want to learn to walk without blinking i want to outlive the turtle and the turtles father the stone i want a mouth full of permissions and a pink glistening bud if the wildflower and ant hill can return after sleeping each season i want to walk out of this house wearing nothing but wind i want to greet you i want to wait for the bus with you weighing less than a chill i want to fight off the bolts of gray lighting the alcoves and winding paths of your hair i want to fight off the damp nudgings of snow i want to fight off the wind i want to be the wind and i want to fight off the wind with its sagging banner of isolation its swinging screen doors its gilded boxes and neatly folded pamphlets of noise i want to fight off the dull straight lines of two by fours and endings your disapprovals your doubts and regulations your carbon copies if the locust can abandon its suit i want a brand new name i want the peppers fury and the salts tenderness i want the virtue of the evening rain but not its gossip i want the moons intuition but not its questions i want the malice of nothing on earth i want to enter every room in a strange electrified city and find you there i want your lips around the bell of flesh at the bottom of my ear i want to be the mirror but not the nightstand i do not want to be the light switch i do not want to be the yellow photograph or book of poems when i leave this body woman i want to be pure flame i want to be your song here take my picture though i bid farewell thine in my heart where my soul dwells shall dwell tis like me now but i dead twill be more when we are shadows both than twas before when weather beaten i come back my hand perhaps with rude oars torn or sun beams tannd my face and breast of haircloth and my head with cares rash sudden storms being oerspread my bodya sack of bones broken within and powders blue stains scatterd on my skin if rival fools tax thee tohave lovd a man so foul and coarse as oh i may seem then this shall say what i was and thou shalt say do his hurts reach me doth my worth decay or do they reach his judging mind that he should now love less what he did love to see that which in him was fair and delicate was but the milk which in loves childish state did nurse it who now is grown strong enough to feed on that which to disusd tastes seems tough castaways we hit the forest our camping stoveturned low i gripped my tent close for its trialin virgin attitudes of stiffness whilelamps fluttered on the dark my roof sank waveon wave accordion like the only sinwe knew and soon the jameson appeared id burned one back and by the thirdshe laid her hand on mine like a napkin later i caught those tiny gasps from joanand michaels tent where he slipped into herlike this i thought a frog la bash those dark rippling walls where she kept center held her breath so i had to puzzle howone could leave and neither be alone three summers since i chose a maid too young maybe but mores to do at harvest time than bide and woo when us was wed she turned afraid of love and me and all things human like the shut of a winters day her smile went out and twadnt a woman more like a little frightened fay one night in the fall she runned away out mong the sheep her be they said should properly have been abed but sure enough she wadnt there lying awake with her wide brown stare so over seven acre field and up along across the down we chased her flying like a hare before out lanterns to church town all in a shiver and a scare we caught her fetched her home at last and turned the key upon her fast she does the work about the house as well as most but like a mouse happy enough to chat and play with birds and rabbits and such as they so long as men folk keep away not near not near her eyes beseech when one of us comes within reach the women say that beasts in stall look round like children at her call ive hardly heard her speak at all shy as a leveret swift as he straight and slight as a young larch tree sweet as the first wild violets she to her wild self but what to me the short days shorten and the oaks are brown the blue smoke rises to the low grey sky one leaf in the still air falls slowly down a magpies spotted feathers lie on the black earth spread white with rime the berries redden up to christmas time whats christmas time without there be some other in the house than we she sleeps up in the attic there alone poor maid tis but a stair betwixt us oh my god the down the soft young down of her the brown the brown of her her eyes her hair her hair nothing passes lord but what you allow mornings the milky sap on my knucklesburns last night the piglets fought then suckled in the barn still no word

arm to arm we wake to our neighbor yelling at his son again we wake our neighbor yelling at his son poor kid standing by the porch tracking mud he backs from the shouting his fathers raised fist later i will see him sulking near our feed shed knotting an old piece of garden hose kicking dust ill smile ask if hes ok but right now i listen to johns quiet breathing beside me faith they say is abraham

these words for love for you all these ways to say believe in symphily to say let us live near each other come into the garden maud for the black bat night has flown come into the garden maud i am here at the gate alone and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad and the musk of the rose is blown for a breeze of morning moves and the planet of love is on high beginning to faint in the light that she loves in a bed of daffodil sky to faint in the light of the sun she loves to faint in his light and to die all night have the roses heard the flute violin bassoon all night has the casement jessamine stirrd to the dancers dancing in tune till a silence fell with the waking bird and a hush with the setting moon i said to the lily there is but one with whom she has heart to be gay when will the dancers leave her alone she is weary of dance and play now half to the setting moon are gone and half to the rising day low on the sand and loud on the stone the last wheel echoes away i said to the rose the brief night goes in babble and revel and wine o young lord lover what sighs are those for one that will never be thine but mine but mine so i sware to the rose for ever and ever mine and the soul of the rose went into my blood as the music clashd in the hall and long by the garden lake i stood for i heard your rivulet fall from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood our wood that is dearer than all from the meadow your walks have left so sweet that whenever a march wind sighs he sets the jewel print of your feet in violets blue as your eyes to the woody hollows in which we meet and the valleys of paradise the slender acacia would not shake one long milk bloom on the tree the white lake blossom fell into the lake as the pimpernel dozed on the lea but the rose was awake all night for your sake knowing your promise to me the lilies and roses were all awake they sighd for the dawn and thee queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls come hither the dances are done in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls queen lily and rose in one shine out little head sunning over with curls to the flowers and be their sun there has fallen a splendid tear from the passion flower at the gate she is coming my dove my dear she is coming my life my fate the red rose cries she is near she is near and the white rose weeps she is late the larkspur listens i hear i hear and the lily whispers i wait she is coming my own my sweet were it ever so airy a tread my heart would hear her and beat were it earth in an earthy bed my dust would hear her and beat had i lain for a century dead would start and tremble under her feet and blossom in purple and red dirt on my chin and i wonder am i alreadyin the ground like a toy turned real i cannot shedthe sense that i have died the german wordfor heavens the sameas the german word for sky on hearing a cruelprince was in danger i prayed for him to thrive not for his own sake but for the concubines sure to end up buriedalong

crime who make you so crazy you dont know whether to throw yourself at them or kill them which makes for permanent madness which could be bad for you you better be on the lookout for such circumstances stay away from the night they most likely lurk in corners of the room where they think they being inconspicuous but they so beautiful an aura gives them away stay away from the day they most likely be walking down the street when you least expect it trying to look ordinary but they so fine they break your heart by making you dream of other possibilities stay away from crazy music they most likely be creating it cuz when youre that beautiful you cant help putting it out there everyone knows how dangerous that can get stay away from magic shows especially those involving words words are very tricky things everyone knows words the most common instruments of illusion they most likely be saying them breathing poems so rhythmic you cant help but dance and once you start dancing to words you might never stop after she left the first thing ahmad jamal played was a bridge he fingered water falling over a cantilever made a dark blue truth transparent i try to suspend belief across a span of hand written notes at noon i cross myself over a painted bridge in pittsburgh sauntering from station square to smithfield st haunted by a smell along the monongahela these streets cobble stone memories work overtime in my olfactories once my piano playing girlfriend fingered daisies waving in a breeze then in love with her noes i began sniffing everything but the florid truth is that i gave her a ring of rust on her windowsill a heart broken like a line in a poem my girl left me ahmad jamal was playing wave on my ipod its probably not smart to admit this but what he didnt play came across loudest i only saw her hands say goodbye because of the beauty in my earbuds then i nosed a wine bottle blue scarf shed left on the right arm of a chair be honest would you have sniffed it what song doesnt long for the long fingers of a pianist a cantilever here only holds up meaning i smelled farewell in a coffee shop as she high heeled east sunlight buttered loafing pedestrians shadowed crossing things as i wondered whether jamals main fault was living too long and weathering if his main technique was to cleave themes or to refrain as he plays the heart gives out a rapid repeat a piano bench pines to be dusted with notes can it buckle up such wont maybe there are facets of bridges one will always truss something phonic and unforgettable about how they allow us to cross a wave of daisies in a vase how they ravel aromatic in the mind ahmad jamal waving across the room me damned roiling underneath like a river maybe i dreamt this but when i licked my fingertips to turn the page they became daisies pushing between bricks on a twilit bridge in an uncurtained room across the way a woman in a tight dress paints her lips a deeper red and sizes up her hips for signs of ounces gained since yesterday she has a thoughtful and a clever face but she is also smart enough to know the truth however large the brain may grow the lashes and the earrings must keep pace although ive spread my books in front of me with a majestic air of ill show her im much less confident than id prefer and now ive started pacing nervously im poring over theorems tomes and tracts im getting ready for a heavy date by staying up ridiculously late but a small voice advises face the facts go on this way and youll soon come to harm the worlds most famous scholars wander down the most appalling alleyways in town a blond and busty airhead on each arm there is an inner motor known as lust that makes a man of learning walk a mile to gratify his raging senses while the woman he can talk to gathers dust a chilling vision of the years ahead invades my thoughts and widens like a stain a barren dance card and a teeming brain a crowded bookcase and an empty bed what if i compromised id stay up late to hone my elocutionary skills and at the crack of dawn id swallow pills to calm my temper and control my weight but i just cant romantics so far gone they think their lovers live for wisdom woo by growing wiser when i think of you i find the nearest lamp and turn it on great gods of longing watch me as i work and if i sprout a martyrs smarmy grin please find some violent way to do me in im burning all these candles not to shirk a night of passion but to give that night a richly textured backdrop when it comes the girl who gets up from her desk and dumbs her discourse down has never seen the flight of wide eyed starlings from their shabby cage the fool whose love is truest is the one who knows a lovers work is never done ill call you when ive finished one more page let the musicians begin let every instrument awaken and instruct us in loves willing river and loves dear discipline we wait silent in consent and in the penance of patience awaiting the serene exaltation which is the liberation and conclusion of expiation now may the chief musician say lust and emulation have dwelt amoung us like barbarous kings have conquered us have inhabited our hearts devoured and ravished with the savage greed and avarice of fire the substance of pity and compassion now may all the players play the river of the morning the morning of the river flow out of the splendor of the tenderness of surrender now may the chief musician say nothing is more important than summer and now the entire choir shall chant how often the astonished heart beholding the laurel remembers the dead and the enchanted absolute snows kingdom sleeps dominion then shall the chief musician declare the phoenix is the meaning of the fruit until the dream is knowledge and knowledge is a dream and then once again the entire choir shall cry in passionate unity singing and celebrating love and loves victory ascending and descending the heights of assent climbing and chanting triumphantly before the morning was you were before the snow shone and the light sang and the stone abiding rode the fullness or endured the emptiness you were you were alone i ive felt undeserving ive made myself ill with the glory in the unleavened garden disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake what made me cover that which i could not have ive grieved and walked in catacombs ive felt undeserving ive made myself ill with the glory even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation i disgorge the lies and abhor the serpents hiss i remember seasons things i bring from far away and grieve i walk in catacombs in gardens now by the stone walls sunlight closes the falling leaves gesture their renunciation i remember being in a field touching a mans body i remember seasons things i bring from far away and things that hold their breath for shame his skin was soft as a girls and he closed his eyes i placed apple petals on his eyelids we were lying in a field and i touched his body then there were clouds an uncanny silence as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame what made me covet what i could not have ill with the power and glory a thrashing in my chest i remember the unleavened gardens petals falling singly the yellow snake disgorging lies ii ive grieved and walked in catacombs ive felt undeserving ive made myself ill with the glory power and glory a thrashing in my rib cage ive gone into the unleavened spring garden disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake ive grieved and walked in catacombs what made me cover that which i could not have ive felt undeserving in this bright land that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow i remember seasons things i bring with me from far away and things that hold their breath as if for shame ive made myself ill with the power and glory ive gone into the unleavened garden and startled a yellow snake disgorging lies a thrashing in my rib cage what made me cover what i could not have i remember seasons things that hold their breath for shame things i bring with me from far away iii ive made myself ill with the power and glory ive made myself ill with the power and glory this was my gig white lace apron cut out bra and crop i crouched above him every thursday in the marble bathroom pissed on his bare chest as let him lick me dry he wasnt the first to love the thought of the redness of a bottom mark of a heel so when my ex dropped three tabs of sunshine and decided id screwed his best friend i thought i knew what to expect hadnt the drag queen across the street pistol whipped sat silent on her folded raincoat there is nothing anyone can do she said and the bistro patrons hailed their cabs and stepped over her and when he held me dangling over west end window wide onto the avenue i know the woman outside the building with her collar open back to god heard me get it as i prayed for one less smack against the sill mark but this flea and mark in this how little that which thou deniest me is it sucked me first and now sucks thee and in this flea our two bloods mingled be thou knowst that this cannot be said a sin nor shame nor loss of maidenhead yet this enjoys before it woo and pampered swells with one blood made of two and this alas is more than we would do oh stay three lives in one flea spare where we almost nay more than married are this flea is you and i and this our marriage bed and marriage temple is though parents grudge and you ware met and cloistered in these living walls of jet though use make you apt to kill me let not to that self murder added be and sacrilege three sins in killing three cruel and sudden hast thou since purpled thy nail in blood of innocence wherein could this flea guilty be except in that drop which it sucked from thee yet thou triumphst and sayst that thou findst not thy self nor me the weaker now tis true then learn how false fears be just so much honor when thou yieldst to me will waste as this fleas death took life from thee i can love both fair and brown her whom abundance melts and her whom want betrays her who loves loneness best and her who masks and plays her whom the country formed and whom the town her who believes and her who tries her who still weeps with spongy eyes and her who is dry cork and never cries i can love her and her and you and you i can love any so she be not true will no other vice content you will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers or have you all old vices spent and now would find out others or doth a fear that men are true torment you o we are not be not you so let me and do you twenty know rob me but bind me not and let me go must i who came to travail thorough you grow your fixed subject because you are true venus heard me sigh this song and by loves sweetest part variety she swore she heard not this till now and that it should be so no more she went examined and returned ere long and said alas some two or three poor heretics in love there be which think to stablish dangerous constancy but i have told them since you will be true you shall be true to them who are false to you then the long fencerow that years ago had heaved and buckled took on a copper shine in the sunset the dew a garlic haze of cut pastures simmered fields away they were flushed from sex they were traced with that other body just parted they stood in the length of first fall waiting and their skin that had been so willing delible as ash to a trembling fingertip became its own again one star three nothing good was going to happen night winds lifted themselves out of wheat rows and shook off what had been done so they turned elsewhere her fingers gathered up her collar softly in a bunch and she put on a scarf it was not even cold it was only cool start this with the invocation a seventy seven pinto an eastbound freeway two boysa few months from their drivers license it happens again because youve said it you sit in the back seat a ghost of red vinyl to listento these boys one of whom was you the one along for the ride talk brave about cheerleaders and socket wrenches as they passa stolen cigarette between them they dont know youre there wouldnt believe in you should they look backstage backseat the boys are driving back from an octoberorchard where theyd gone to see leaves change you remember orange brown

one driving and picking at the thinhair falling from his scalp will diesoon because what lurks in his dark blood can be cured by medical science and that cure is what willkill him as it leaves him weak unable to fight off infection in his lungs but that comes later you are here with them now to findout what you owe to whom your life mortgaged to one of these boys and youve never been able to rectify that debt you are thestage direction a ghost backstage wanting a spotlight a soapbox a soliloquy dissolve back into your life like sugarin tea exit this scene now stage left you are the apparition again in your mothers house you follow yourself down the yellow hallwayto the ringing phone in the kitchen you already know whos calling the way you knew then when you were the self youre haunting your friendis dead you know this even before his sister tells you but because your ghost is too close the boy can feel your grief but cant feel his own and you did know then didnt you you

pans praises meet chorus of pan the flowery pastures sing caves echo and the fountains ring sing then while he doth us inspire for all the world is our pans choir just as in the horror movies when someone discovers that the phone calls are coming from inside the house so too i realized that our tender overlapping has been taking place only inside me all that sweetness the love and desire its just been me dialing myself then following the ringing to another room to find no one on the line well sometimes a little breathing but more often than not nothing to think that all this time which would include the boat rides the airport embraces and all the drinks its been only me and the two telephones the one on the wall in the kitchen and the extension in the darkened guest room upstairs a french scholar says he affected the chinese manner when he took his friends into the countryside to look at blossoms they all saw chinese blossoms he dressed accordingly and wept for the wild geese of shosho one year after making love through the short midsummer night he walked home at dawn and noticed that the river oi had sunk two feet the following year was better he saw bubbles of crab froth among the river reeds o swallow swallow flying flying south fly to her and fall upon her gilded eaves and tell her tell her what i tell to thee o tell her swallow thou that knowest each that bright and fierce and fickle is the south and dark and true and tender is the north o swallow swallow if i could follow and light upon her lattice i would pipe and trill and cheep and twitter twenty million loves o were i thou that she might take me in and lay me on her bosom and her heart would rock the snowy cradle till i died why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love delaying as the tender ash delays to clothe herself when all the woods are green o tell her swallow that thy brood is flown say to her i do but wanton in the south but in the north long since my nest is made o tell her brief is life but love is long and brief the sun of summer in the north and brief the moon of beauty in the south o swallow flying from the golden woods fly to her and pipe and woo her and make her mine and tell her tell her that i follow thee spare us your burial rites spare us the first rib the flood the resurrection spare us your dairy meats your belief in a life after this one heavens a city weve been priced out of our mothers fled for more affordable children for the price of liver heaven wants nothing to do with pleasure on earth on this the occasion of my brothers wedding i need something

gleams athwart a crimson soullambent flames purple passion lurksin your dusk eyes red mouth flower soft your soul leaps up and flashesstar like white flame hot curving arms encircling a world of love you stirring the depths of passionate desire i am always hungry wanting to have sex this is a fact if you get right down to it the new unprocessed peanut butter is no damn good you should buy it in a jar as always in the largest supermarket you know and i am an enemy of change as you know all the things i embrace as new are in fact old things re released swimming the sensation of being dirty in body and mind summer as a time to do nothing and make no money prayer as a last re sort pleasure as a means and then a means again with no ends in sight i am absolutely in opposition to all kinds of goals i have no desire to know where this anything is getting me when the water boils i get a cup of tea accidentally i read all the works of proust it was summer i was there so was he i write because i would like to be used for years after my death not only my body will be compost but the thoughts i left during my life during my life i was a woman with hazel eyes out the window is a crooked silo parts of your body i think of as stripes which i have learned to love along we swim naked in ponds i write be hind your back my thoughts about you are not exactly forbidden but exalted because they are useless not intended to get you because i have you you love me its more like a playground where i play with my reflection of you until you come back and into the real you i get to sink my teeth with you i know how to relax so i work behind your back which is lovely nature is out of control you tell me thats whats so good about it im immoderately in love with you knocked out by all your new white hair why shouldnt something i have always known be the very best there is i love you from my childhood starting back there when one day was just like the rest random growth and breezes constant love a sand wich in the middle of day a tiny step in the vastly conventional path of the sun i squint i wink i take the ride we cannot live except thus mutually we alternate aware or unaware the reflex act of life and when we bear our virtue onward most impulsively most full of invocation and to be most instantly compellant certes there we live most life whoever breathes most air and counts his dying years by sun and sea but when a soul by choice and conscience doth throw out her full force on another soul the conscience and the concentration both make mere life love for life in perfect whole and aim consummated is love in sooth as natures magnet heat rounds pole with pole was helen stronger than achilles even as the arrows fell that could not be but he recognised in her some power other than her legendary beauty he could name helena but the other he could not name she was a lure a light an intimate flame a secret kept even from his slaves the elect the innermost hierarchy only helena could be named and she was a public scandal in any case a cause of shame to agamemnon and menelaus it was not that she was beautiful true she stood on the walls taut and indifferent as the arrows fell it was not that she was beautiful there were others in spite of the legend as gracious as tall it was not that she was beautiful but he stared and stared across the charred wood and the smouldering flame till his eyes cleared and the smoke drifted away out of the cradle endlessly rocking out of the mocking birds throat the musical shuttle out of the ninth month midnight over the sterile sands and the fields beyond where the child leaving his bed wanderd alone bareheaded barefoot down from the showerd halo up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive out from the patches of briers and blackberries from the memories of the bird that chanted to me from your memories sad brother from the fitful risings and fallings i heard from under that yellow half moon late risen and swollen as if with tears from those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist from the thousand responses of my heart never to cease from the myriad thence arousd words from the word stronger and more delicious than any from such as now they start the scene revisiting as a flock twittering rising or overhead passing borne hither ere all eludes me hurriedly a man yet by these tears a little boy again throwing myself on the sand confronting the waves i chanter of pains and joys uniter of here and hereafter taking all hints to use them but swiftly leaping beyond them a reminiscence sing once paumanok when the lilac scent was in the air and fifth month grass was growing up this seashore in some briers two featherd guests from alabama two together and their nest and four light green eggs spotted with brown and every day the he bird to and fro near at hand and every day the she bird crouchd on her nest silent with bright eyes and every day i a curious boy never too close never disturbing them cautiously peering absorbing translating shine shine shine pour down your warmth great sun while we bask we two together two together winds blow south or winds blow north day come white or night come black home or rivers and mountains from home singing all time minding no time while we two keep together till of a sudden may be killd unknown to her mate one forenoon the she bird crouchd not on the nest nor returnd that afternoon nor the next nor ever appeard again and thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather over the hoarse surging of the sea or flitting from brier to brier by day i saw i heard at intervals the remaining one the he bird the solitary guest from alabama blow blow blow blow up sea winds along paumanoks shore i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me yes when the stars glistend all night long on the prong of a moss scallopd stake down almost amid the slapping waves sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears he calld on his mate he pourd forth the meanings which i of all men know yes my brother i know the rest might not but i have treasurd every note for more than once dimly down to the beach gliding silent avoiding the moonbeams blending myself with the shadows recalling now the obscure shapes the echoes the sounds and sights after their sorts the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing i with bare feet a child the wind wafting my hair listend long and long listend to keep to sing now translating the notes following you my brother soothe soothe soothe close on its wave soothes the wave behind and again another behind embracing and lapping every one close but my love soothes not me not me low hangs the moon it rose late it is lagging o i think it is heavy with love with love o madly the sea pushes upon the land with love with love o night do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers what is that little black thing i see there in the white loud loud loud loud i call to you my love high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves surely you must know who is here is here you must know who i am my love low hanging moon what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow o it is the shape the shape of my mate o moon do not keep her from me any longer land land o land whichever way i turn o i think you could give me my mate back again if you only would for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look o rising stars perhaps the one i want so much will rise will rise with some of you o throat o trembling throat sound clearer through the atmosphere pierce the woods the earth somewhere listening to catch you must be the one i want shake out carols solitary here the nights carols carols of lonesome love deaths carols carols under that lagging yellow waning moon o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea o reckless despairing carols but soft sink low soft let me just murmur and do you wait a moment you husky noisd sea for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me so faint i must be still be still to listen but not altogether still for then she might not come immediately to me hither my love here i am here with this just sustaind note i announce myself to you this gentle call is for you my love for you do not be decoyd elsewhere that is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice that is the fluttering the fluttering of the spray those are the shadows of leaves o darkness o in vain o i am very sick and sorrowful o brown halo in the sky near the moon drooping upon the sea o troubled reflection in the sea o throat o throbbing heart and i singing uselessly uselessly all the night o past o happy life o songs of joy in the air in the woods over fields loved loved loved loved loved but my mate no more no more with me we two together no more the aria sinking all else continuing the stars shining the winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoing with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning on the sands of paumanoks shore gray and rustling the yellow half moon enlarged sagging down drooping the face of the sea almost touching the boy ecstatic with his bare feet the waves with his hair the atmosphere dallying the love in the heart long pent now loose now at last tumultuously bursting the arias meaning the ears the soul swiftly depositing the strange tears down the cheeks coursing the colloquy there the trio each uttering the undertone the savage old mother incessantly crying to the boys souls questions sullenly timing some drownd secret hissing to the outsetting bard demon or bird said the boys soul is it indeed toward your mate you sing or is it really to me for i that was a child my tongues use sleeping now i have heard you now in a moment i know what i am for i awake and already a thousand singers a thousand songs clearer louder and more sorrowful than yours a thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me never to die o you singer solitary singing by yourself projecting me o solitary me listening never more shall i cease perpetuating you never more shall i escape never more the reverberations never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what there in the night by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon the messenger there arousd the fire the sweet hell within the unknown want the destiny of me o give me the clew it lurks in the night here somewhere o if i am to have so much let me have more a word then for i will conquer it the word final superior to all subtle sent up what is it i listen are you whispering it and have been all the time you sea waves is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands whereto answering the sea delaying not hurrying not whisperd me through the night and very plainly before day break lispd to me the low and delicious word death and again death death death death hissing melodious neither like the bird nor like my arousd childs heart but edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over death death death death death which i do not forget but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanoks gray beach with the thousand responsive songs at random my own songs awaked from that hour and with them the key the word up from the waves the word of the sweetest song and all songs that strong and delicious word which creeping to my feet or like some old crone rocking the cradle swathed in sweet garments bending aside the sea whisperd me the breath the trees the bridge the road the rain the sheen the breath the line the skin the vineyard the fences the leg the water the breath the shift the hair the wheels the shoulder the breath the lane the streak the lining the hour the reasons the name the distance the breath the scent the dogs the blear the lungs the breath the glove the signal the turn the need the steps the lights the door the mouth the tongue the eyes the burn the burned the burning mama said it only existed in storybooks with its soft surface of bluebells but there it was spinning so close to the earth that it bentevery weather vane in omaha it was prom nightand i thought id pluck a few trumpetsto bring your grandma so i pulled our red ladder out of the garage and climbed to the roof i stood up and imagined i was balancing the moon on my head the narrow windows of union station gleamed like ice chips and the thin faces of the clock tower told me it was almost eight i was going to be late picking nancy up if i didnt get a move on so i snipped off the best stems and hurried back down to my ford i sped through every stop sign on my way to her parents house she was waiting with her arms crossed trying not to look upset i think she thought she was going to get stood up so when i popped open the door and told her to get in she couldnt help smiling a bit she asked whatd taken me so longand i figured i should go ahead and give her the flowersid brought her id set themback behind the steering wheel to not ruin the surprise i told her she was the princess and i was the knightwho rode into the starsso he could flare their notes to her on a blue horn do you remember the rude nudists lazing easy in girth and tongue wet slops and smacks of flesh as they buttered every crevice sungrunts blubberpalaver we were always hiking some hill toward some beauty some human meanness ruined we were always waiting too long to let ourselves be seen it was an oceans gesticulations articulate elephant seals grounded clouds grown all one mouth what could we do but laugh casting clothes aside as if the air were ice and water a warm bed goose stepping goose pimpled past their appeased surprise into the waves what could we do we could we did love take a long look at each other and creep quietly away after all theres no need to say anything at first an orange peeled and quartered flares like a tulip on a wedgewood plate anything can happen outside the sun has rolled up her rugs and night strewn salt across the sky my heart is humming a tune i havent heard in years quiets cool flesh lets sniff and eat it there are ways to make of the moment a topiary so the pleasures in walking through let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine that bravely maskd their fancies may be told or pindars apes flaunt they in phrases fine enamling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold or else let them in statelier glory shine ennobling newfound tropes with problems old or with strange similes enrich each line of herbs or beasts which ind or afric hold for me in sooth no muse but one i know phrases and problems from my reach do grow and strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites how then even thus in stellas face i read what love and beauty be then all my deed but copying is what in her nature writes madison avenue door to heaven portal stopped realities and eternal licentiousness or at least the jungle of impossible eagerness your marble is bronze and your lianas elevator cables swinging from the myth of ascending i would join or declining the challenge of racial attractions they zing on into the lynch dear friends while everywhere love is breathing draftily like a doorway linking rd with th the east bound with the west bound traffic by s o midtown tunnels and the tunnels too of holland where is the summit where all aims are clear the pin point light upon a fear of lust as agonys needlework grows up around the unicorn and fences him for milk and yoghurt work when i see gianni i know hes thinking of john ericson playing the rachmaninoff nd or elizabeth taylor taking sleeping pills and jane thinks of manderley and irkutsk while i cough lightly in the smog of desire and my eyes water achingly imitating the true blue a sight of manahatta in the towering needle multi faceted insight of the fly in the stringless labyrinth canada plans a higher place than the empire state building i am getting into a cab at th street and st avenue and the negro driver tells me about a apartment where you cant walk across the floor after at night not even to pee cause it keeps them awake downstairs no i dont like that well i didnt take it perfect in the hot humid morning on my way to work a little supper club conversation for the mill of the gods you were there always and you know all about these things as indifferent as an encyclopedia with your calm brown eyes it isnt enough to smile when you run the gauntlet youve got to spit like niagara falls on everybody or victoria falls or at least the beautiful urban fountains of madrid as the niger joins the gulf of guinea near the menemsha bar that is what you learn in the early morning passing madison avenue where youve never spent any time and stores eat up light i have always wanted to be near it though the day is long and i dont mean madison avenue lying in a hammock on st marks place sorting my poems in the rancid nourishment of this mountainous island they are coming and we holy ones must go is tibet historically a part of china as i historically belong to the enormous bliss of american death but there is no proof but proof no mark but the good news that there is no bad news yet again i wish i knew the nausea its thick yell in the morning the pregnant proof that in you life swells i know im not a mother but i know what it is to nurse a thing you want to kill but cant you learn to love it yes i love my sweet virus it is my proof of life my toxic angel wasted utopia what makes my blood my blood i understand belle now how she could love the beast if you stare at fangs long enough even fangs pink with your own blood look soft low key later it felt like i got it out the way to finally know it up close see it in the mirror it doesnt feel good to say that it doesnt feel good to know your need outweighed your fear i braved a stupid ocean a man i waded in his stupid waters i took his stupid salt let it brine my skin took his stupid fish into my hands bit into it like a flapping plum i kissed at his stupid coral stupid algae it was stupid silly really i knew nothing that easy to get good to feel isnt also trying to eat you knew what could happen needed no snake grew the fruit myself was the vine the rain the light the dirt was me the hands drilling into the dirt were my hands i made the blade that cut me down but i only knew how to live when i knew how ill die i want to live think i mean it take the pill even on the days i think i wont survive myself gave my body a shot love myself at least that much thank you me thank you pill seafoam bland thank you sick blood my first husband dead river bright with salmon on one occasion y gen of ise province was offering to share for a night or two the comforts of his home with me when a distant bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day then to a degree i would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice so worn out not even sure i was on the right road i forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand in hand in the same direction both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire but i am so tired i heard my own voice say one of them that startlingly cruel intrusive voice i hate darkening everything how sick i am of listening to it and of having to go on but after some time had passed once again i forgot all about it as i sat there the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or perhaps a hidden joy of my own one i had so long considered extinct when y gen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking renga competitions and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again i think of her sometimes moon come down andcome alone i have to tell you allabout akechis wife bash translated by franz wright this room how well i know it now theyre renting it and the one next to it as offices the whole house has become an office building for agents businessmen companies this room how familiar it is the couch was here near the door a turkish carpet in front of it close by the shelf with two yellow vases on the right no opposite a wardrobe with a mirror in the middle the table where he wrote and the three big wicker chairs beside the window the bed where we made love so many times they must still be around somewhere those old things beside the window the bed the afternoon sun used to touch half of it one afternoon at four oclock we separated for a week only and then that week became forever tulsidas the poet was wandering deep in thought by the ganges in that lonely spot where they burn their dead he found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband gaily dressed as for a wedding she rose as she saw him bowed to him and said permit me master with your blessing to follow my husband to heaven why such hurry my daughter asked tulsidas is not this earth also his who made heaven for heaven i do not long said the woman i want my husband tulsidas smiled and said to her go back to your home my child before the month is over you will find your husband the woman went back with glad hope tulsidas came to her every day and gave her high thoughts to think till her heart was filled to the brim with divine love when the month was scarcely over her neighbours came to her asking woman have you found your husband the widow smiled and said i have eagerly they asked where is he in my heart is my lord one with me said the woman yes i answered you last night no this morning sir i say colours seen by candle light will not look the same by day when the tabors played their best lamps above and laughs below love me sounded like a jest fit for yes or fit for no call me false or call me free vow whatever light may shine no man on your face shall see any grief for change on mine yet the sin is on us both time to dance is not to woo wooer light makes fickle troth scorn of me recoils on you learn to win a ladys faith nobly as the thing is high bravely as for life and death with a loyal gravity lead her from the festive boards point her to the starry skies guard her by your truthful words pure from courtships flatteries by your truth she shall be true ever true as wives of yore and her yes once said to you shall be yes for evermore by any measure it was endless winter emulsions with then circled the lake like this is it this april will be inadequate sensitivity to green i rose early erased for an hour silk brush and ax id like to think im a different person latent image fading around the edges and ears overall a tighter face now is it so hard for you to understand from the drop down menu in a cluster of eight poems i selected sleep but could not i decided to change everything composed entirely of stills or fade into the trees but could not remember the dream save for one brief shot of a woman opening her eyes ari pick up im a different person in a perfect world this would be april or an associated concept green to the touch several feet away all trembling in my arms aminta lay defending of the bliss i strove to take raising my rapture by her kind delay her force so charming was and weak the soft resistance did betray the grant while i pressed on the heaven of my desires her rising breasts with nimbler motions pant her dying eyes assume new fires now to the height of languishment she grows and still her looks new charms put on now the last mystery of love she knows we sigh and kiss i waked and all was done twas but a dream yet by my heart i knew which still was panting part of it was true oh how i strove the rest to have believed ashamed and angry to be undeceived unhappy pen and ill accepted papers that intimate in vain my chaste desires my chaste desires the ever burning tapers enkindled by her eyes celestial fires celestial fires and unrespecting powers that deign not view the glory of your might in humble lines the work of careful hours the sacrifice i offer to her sight but since she scorns her own this rests for me ill moan my self and hide the wrong i have and so content me that her frowns should be to my infant style the cradle and the grave what though my self no honor get thereby each bird sings therself and so will i immersed we dont ask who entered whose stream take my hand there is no line no bridge only fond foolishness the bread crumbs i bring you in morning they float on the surface water with two violins un strung like the silent song on your lips soft as the same hands i crushed to keep you from death i have to tell you there are times when the sun strikes me like a gong and i remember everything even your ears if one could have that little head of hers painted upon a background of pale gold such as the tuscans early art prefers no shade encroaching on the matchless mould of those two lips which should be opening soft in the pure profile not as when she laughs for that spoils all but rather as if aloft yon hyacinth she loves so leaned its staffs burthen of honey coloured buds to kiss and capture twixt the lips apart for this then her lithe neck three fingers might surround how it should waver on the pale gold ground up to the fruit shaped perfect chin it lifts i know correggio loves to mass in rifts of heaven his angel faces orb on orb breaking its outline burning shades absorb but these are only massed there i should think waiting to see some wonder momently grow out stand full fade slow against the sky thats the pale ground youd see this sweet face by all heaven meanwhile condensed into one eye which fears to lose the wonder should it wink dear miss first of all i want to say that i have enjoyed the imaginary possibility built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature i have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women i have imagined myself in such postures with you where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal as men give vast lands to little papers with line and color i have imagined more on the surface of your body giving all the universe in this model yet i must be curious about your breasts curious hungry is the word to see to touch to taste i am curious as to how your hands undress your body i am interested in your mind will you undress in front of me will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off i feel that if i should have my penis in your vagina i should have your love for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons if love has reasons i cannot tell your admirer having this day my horse my hand my lance guided so well that i obtaind the prize both by the judgment of the english eyes and of some sent from that sweet enemy france horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance town folks my strength a daintier judge applies his praise to sleight which from good use doth rise some lucky wits impute it but to chance others because of both sides i do take my blood from them who did excel in this think nature me a man of arms did make how far they shot awry the true cause is stella lookd on and from her heavnly face sent forth the beams which made so fair my race the eyes open to a cry of pulleys and spirited from sleep the astounded soul hangs for a moment bodiless and simple as false dawn outside the open window the morning air is all awash with angels some are in bed sheets some are in blouses some are in smocks but truly there they are now they are rising together in calm swells of halcyon feeling filling whatever they wear with the deep joy of their impersonal breathing now they are flying in place conveying the terrible speed of their omnipresence moving and staying like white water and now of a sudden they swoon down into so rapt a quiet that nobody seems to be there the soul shrinks from all that it is about to remember from the punctual rape of every bless d day and cries oh let there be nothing on earth but laundry nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam and clear dances done in the sight of heaven yet as the sun acknowledges with a warm look the worlds hunks and colors the soul descends once more in bitter love to accept the waking body saying now in a changed voice as the man yawns and rises bring them down from their ruddy gallows let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone and the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating of dark habits keeping their difficult balance theres nothing more erotic than one red chilean plum slumbered in the brown palm of the curved hand of the right man x should the wide world roll away leaving black terror limitless night nor god nor man nor place to stand would be to me essential if thou and thy white arms were there and the fall to doom a long way th expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action lust is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust enjoyed no sooner but despis d straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and proved a very woe before a joy proposed behind a dream all this the world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell you saved me you should remember me the spring of the year young men buying tickets for the ferryboats laughter because the air is full of apple blossoms when i woke up i realized i was capable of the same feeling i remember sounds like that from my childhood laughter for no cause simply because the world is beautiful something like that lugano tables under the apple trees deckhands raising and lowering the colored flags and by the lakes edge a young man throws his hat into the water perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him crucial sounds or gestures like a track laid down before the larger themes and then unused buried islands in the distance my mother holding out a plate of little cakes as far as i remember changed in no detail the moment vivid intact having never been exposed to light so that i woke elated at my age hungry for life utterly confident by the tables patches of new grass the pale green pieced into the dark existing ground surely spring has been returned to me this time not as a lover but a messenger of death yet it is still spring it is still meant tenderly the writer its a cul de sac you wrote that winter of our nations discontent that first time i found you blue marble lying still in the trench you staked in waiting for something anything but the cell of your small apartment with the fixtures never scrubbed the seven great named cats you gassed in the move i couldnt keep them you explained so i understood and what cat never loved your shell like ways the claw of your steady fingers firme from the rasping of banjos and steady as it goes from the nose to the hair to the shaking tip my favorite tale was of the owl and the pussycat in love in a china cup cast at sea or in a flute more brittle more lifelike and riddled with flair the exquisite polish of its gaudy glaze now puzzled with heat cracks now foamed opalescent as the single espresso dish you bought from goodwill what ever becomes of the heart our common child fashioned red silk and golden satin the gay glitter fallen from moves our names with love written in black felt pen who gets what who knows what becomes of the rose you carried home from spanish harlem that morning i sat waiting for the surgeons suction what ever becomes of waiting and wanting when the princess isnt ready and the queen has missed the boat again do you still write those old remarks etched on a page of kandinskys ace letting go like lorna meets oliver north and she kicks his butt the dates are immaterial to me as salvation or a freer light bending through stallions in an air gone heavy with underground tunnels do you read me is there some library where youll find me smashed on the page of some paper let it go is my morning mantra gone blind with the saved backing of a clock now dark as an empty womb when i wake now listening for your tick or the sound of white walls on a sticky street engines out the window remind me of breathing apparatus at the breaking of new worlds the crash and perpetual maligning of the sand bar where sea lions sawed up logs for a winter cabin i dream wood smoke in the morning i dream the rank and file of used up chimneys what that night must have smelled like her mussed and toweled positioning my ambulance of heart through stopped traffic where you picked the right corner to tell me they think someone murdered her you were there all right you were a statue carved from the stone of your birth you were patient as a sparrow under leaf and as calm as the bay those light evenings when i envisioned you with the fishwife you loved and yes i could have done it then kissed it off when the scalpel of single star brightened and my world blazed a dying bulb for the finger of a socket like our sunsets on the cape fallen fish blood in snow the hearts and diamonds we found and left alone on a new england grave why was the summer so long then even now a golden season stumps me and i stamp ants on the brilliant iced drifts i walk a steady mile to that place where you left it that solid gold band thrown away to a riptide in a gesture the theatrical love so well what was my role or did i leave it undelivered when they handed me the gun of my triggered smiles and taught me to cock it did i play it to the hilt and bleeding did i plunge in your lap and wake to find you lonely in a ribbon of breathing tissue does this impudent muscle die does love expire do eternal nestings mean much more than a quill gone out or the spit i spy the bank of frothed fog fuming with airbrushed pussies on a pink horizon i scored my shoes with walking my skill is losing its what we do best us ducks us lessons on what not to do thanks for the crack you wrote in my o e d that th renewal when the summer snapped and hissed suddenly like a bullet of coal flung from a fire place or a dumb swallow who dove into the pit for pay kiss her and its good luck i palm this lucky trade but the soot never sells and i never sailed away on a gulf stream that divides continents from ourselves but only half of me is cracked the other is launched on a wild bob a buoy steadfast in storm i may sail to asia or i might waft aimlessly to spain where my hemp first dried from the rain my messages wring from the line unanswered pressed sheets from an old wash or the impression of a holy thing but dont pull no science on this shroud the date will only lie shell tell you its sacred even sell you a piece of the fray she appears on the cracked ravines of this country like a ghost on the windshield of an oncoming train she refuses to die but just look at her nation without a spare penny to change my wear is a glass made clean through misuse the mishandling of my age as revealing as my erased face indian head of my stick birth my battle buried under an island of snow ive yet to get to what could i do with this neighborhood of avenues scattered with empty shells of mailboxes their feet caked with cement like pulled up pilings evidently they havent a word for regret full heart someday i said i can write us both from this mess but the key stalls out from under me when i spell your name i have to fake the o or go over it again in the dark a tracing of differences spilled out on a sheet if i could stick this back together would it stay its no rope i know and no good for holding clear liquid i gather a froth on my gums and grin the way an old woman grimaces in a morning mirror i was never a clear thing never felt the way a daughter feels never lost out like you never drove my moon waits at the edge of an eagles aerie almost extinct and the eggs are fragile from poisoned ignitions im never coming out from my cup of tea never working loose the grease in my hair the monkey grease from my dancing elbows that jab at your shoulder but i write and wait for the book to sell for i know nothing comes of it but the past with its widening teeth with its meat breath baited at my neck persistent as the smell of a drunk dont tell me i already know its just the rule of the game for the jack of all hearts and for the queen of baguettes its a cul de sac for a joker drawing hearts the rat traps emptied the grain troughs filled the distance between sheep shed and my own ice melt dripping on the matequals the diameter of moonlight squaredon his face as he looks upand finds me again sayshes sure id been swallowedby the elements says hed beenabout to come looking i step intothe warm two baas from out backwhere id worked two tufts of woolhe lifts from my hair in just such a manner are sleek blue wordsslyly acquired by a wispywhiter than snow page hes seen ithappen seen a tear of mine then two well up and slip loose as the little boat of orgasmveers into the vortex i wanted to tell the veterinary assistant about the cat video jason sent me but i resisted for fear shed think it strange i am very lonely yesterday my boyfriend called me drunk again and interspersed between ringing tears and clinginess he screamed at me with a kind of bitterness no other human had before to my ears and told me that i was no good well maybe he didnt mean that but that is what i heard when he told me my life was not worthwhile and my lifes work the work of the elite i say i want to save the world but really i want to write poems all day i want to rise write poems go to sleep write poems in my sleep make my dreams poems make my body a poem with beautiful clothes i want my face to be a poem i have just learned how to apply eyeliner to the corners of my eyes to make them appear wide there is a romantic abandon in me always i want to feel the dread for others i can feel it through song only through song am i able to sum up so many words into a few like when he said i am no good i am no good goodness is not the point anymore holding on to things now thats the point when my father died he left me a trove of video tapes a warped memorial for those men he watched with my mother before she left for parts unknown for those fights he relived once he was laid off from the plane yards we watched men like sputnik monroe bleed the hard way shook our fists as he broke rules against guys who were easier to cheer he was a bad elvis greased back hair with a shock of white sputnik monroe mixed it up everywhere a rodeo fistfight a henhouse tornado my mother picked a fight in an idaho truck stop once stabbed a mans chest with her middle finger then stepped to one side so my father could fight him in the parking lot afterwards my mother was silent all the way back to seattle her disgust with him the way he wrapped his arm around her shoulder guided her to the car and sped back to the freeway hanging between them from that point forward sputnik monroe clobbered men wherever he went sneered at those fists raised against him in memphis some nights as my wife sleeps upstairs i watch my fathers video tapes and imagine what i would have done that day if i knew that my marriage depended on what i did with my hands merry margaret as midsummer flower gentle as a falcon or hawk of the

like a blue rug you are my favorite violin when you sit and peel my eyes with your great surfaces seem intimate when we merely touch the thread of life and kiss the same to me are sombre days and gay though joyous dawns the rosy morn and bright because my dearest love is gone away within my heart is melancholy night my heart beats low in loneliness despite that riotous summer holds the earth in sway in cerements my spirit is bedight the same to me are sombre days and gay though breezes in the rippling grasses play and waves dash high and far in glorious might i thrill no longer to the sparkling day though joyous dawns the rosy morn and bright ungraceful seems to me the swallows flight as well might heavens blue be sullen gray my soul discerns no beauty in their sight because my dearest love is gone away let roses fling afar their crimson spray and virgin daisies splash the fields with white let bloom the poppy hotly as it may within my heart is melancholy night and this oh love my pitiable plight whenever from my circling arms you stray this little world of mine has lost its light i hope to god my dear that you can say the same to me dear regret my leaning this morning my leather foot want of stone my ageold burnished and bruised my hair lingering my hand caked spongy asnovember my dear relentless my dear aging your voice tinny dissonant as stein shot through decades of war and fortrel cocktails on the hour zeppelins over piccadilly bombing blindly in the fog dear skin dear tobacco mouth my refusal my merely geographic my fibrous strings for you your abundant wit your lack of shadow and still joy nosing the air each moment stretches toward you your dry feet i carried them pumiced and pepperylaid them where regret is a biscuit thing to lean upon and sweeten my hour of you my cursive thoughts a pulpit beating under these ribs dear time you swallowed us whole swallowed us lovely sharp as bonescrimping sadly under foot my benign my flotsam and crabs thin as leaves your smoothing your sinking in mornings or mooring or wallowing jericho tapioca air indolent i am still there supple and driftwood you lovely you loved me your memory dark and west thoughts like tugboats stitchingthe horizon you pulling me my pudding my thin crustacean sidewaysin the late afternoon your gaze having so soon forgotten the sharpness of mornings the bite of your look serrating the hour my treasures all of them for the pleasure of that slice once more of our dangling you and me the lot of us in some car driving some hour mapless under a spiderweb a tire slouched flat sad lipped i think of newton of the original apple all of these clones since all of these scentless descents i shake my glass shake again melted suffixes tinkling observe all things natural foliage unfurling like old bills wryly betraying your habits like the dog who digs and rubs the dog who whines whopaws and circles you trace why is pain so much better than nothing or the mark of it more understandable why is saying nothing so much better your one liner like blossoms uplifting your currents strap me to air yesi guess there is a little texture up here and oxygen pure as babys toeswhich if i recall are sweet as kernels of corn if i recall so long ago to arrive is practice conversation or conversion a story over a field my sweet of concrete or whispering furrows of a path no longer not sure was there and snow combed in curlicues and dog ears a zigzag through january sure you are witty but are you any less romantic in my remembering i have undone all my beliefs it is a luxury to lay unencumbered here or there the bones flexed with tendons the spine like a seahorse the heart far from a cliche unless beating isinnocent though innocence is not as supple as you think nor as flexible nor as perfumed nor convenient or even clean between things regret gathers force i remember that day it was cold and the coffee tepid the small red balloons like thumbprints waves green as the brush of cedar the wind lapping your hoodie blind strings tap the air camerabobbing like a dogs tail such lightness the dog heading off all the dogs of english bay angling off leash i would follow backward lay old maps on your white sheets so sincere i am in earnest for you we wont regret having not yet knit our acrid puns and jaded barbs nor having the wind slip in under our belt loops though i gently refuse gor tex and you bet i will not concede the game those small red balloons like tulips in your eyes specs of amber an amulet an avatar my thoughts of you fully indexed ready to step into o darling the moon did not disrobe you you fell asleep that way nudeand capsized by our wine our bump n grind shenanigans blame iton whatever you like my bed welcomes whomever you decide to be thug mistress poinsettia john doe in the alcove of my dreams youcan quote verbatim an entire albumof bone thugs n harmonywith your ass in the air theres nothingwrong with that they mince syllablesas you call me yours you dont like me but still invite me to your homewhen your homies arent nearenough to hear us crash into each other like hours some men have killed their lovers because they loved themso much in secret that the secret kept coming out wife gouging her husband with suspicion churches sneeringwhen an usher enters never mind that the sickle moon turns the sky into a mans mouth slapped sideways to keep him from spilling what no one wouldunderstand you call me god when it gets good though i do not exist to you outside this room be yourself or no one else here your do rag is camouflage patterned and stuffed into my mouth if i must worry about how i will live in my old age without wealth i would be without health now and how can i live to be old if i must worry about how i will live in my old age without love i would be without dreams now and how can i go on living another day allow me to sit in the sun and listen to the sky i will love you gently allow me to stay in my room and weave my rainbows i will love you truly like a colt in the meadow with no boundary allow me to wander around till i hear the autumn stealthily strolling by my door i will be waiting to be with you then thus piteously love closed what he begat the union of this ever diverse pair these two were rapid falcons in a snare condemned to do the flitting of the bat lovers beneath the singing sky of may they wandered once clear as the dew on flowers but they fed not on the advancing hours their hearts held cravings for the buried day then each applied to each that fatal knife deep questioning which probes to endless dole ah what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certainties in this our life in tragic hints here see what evermore moves dark as yonder midnight oceans force thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse to throw that faint thin line upon the shore long have i longd to see my love againe still have i wisht but never could obtaine it rather than all the world if i might gaine it would i desire my loves sweet precious gaine yet in my soule i see him everie day see him and see his still sterne countenaunce but ah what is of long continuance where majestie and beautie beares the sway sometimes when i imagine that i see him as love is full of foolish fantasies weening to kisse his lips as my loves fees i feele but aire nothing but aire to bee him thus with ixion kisse i clouds in vaine thus with ixion feele i endles paine from behind standing from a distance in passing the taxi meter running id watch her id watch her hair and what would i see my stubborn theatre curtain wont fall my always open theatre best to leave as soon as the show begins yesterday the sunshine made the air glow pushing me like a sixteen year old to toss my shirt off and run along the river shore splashing in the water wading out to the reeds my heart an ancient yaki drum and i believed more than believed the air beneath trees was female blue dancers i approached and there in the dry leaves in the crisp twigs i turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air sunlight in shrub weed skirts i knew the dance that would please the gods i knew the dance that would make the river water smile glistening ever silvering i knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors yeah i wanted to write you a poem woman for two days and today it was gray and snowy and overcast about how i startled the mallards from their shallow refuge beneath the russian olive trees and how the male purposely came close to me diverting my attention to it its female love went the other way risking its life thats what i saw the male fly before the hunters rifles circle in sights of hunters and take the shots the roaring rifle blast after blast and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion thats how i miss you thats how i wanted to write you a poem since we left you one way me another way i was the male taking with me the hunters that would harm you risking my heart so yours wouldnt be hurt fronting myself as possible prey so you could escape that kind of poem i am writing you now circling as hunters aim down on me while you rise rise rise into the blue sky and meet me over in the next fields i wanted to write you a poem for two days now to tell you how happy i was seeing a white crane arc between banks in the irrigation ditch with furious efforts its big wings flapping like an awkward nine year old kid much taller than the others his age with size twelve sneakers flapping down the basketball court but once the white crane found its balance its wings their grace it glided more perfectly than a ballet dancers leap across air all of its feathers ballet dancers toes all of its feathers delicate dancers all of its feathers in motion made me believe in myself but more when it rose swooped up the line of ascent up made me think of the curve of your spine how i traced my finger down your spine when you slept your spine is the ascent of the crane toward the sunshine and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips became air a blue cold artic air you glided up in your song of winter love of that string of memories about our lost friendship i rememberbeing invited places as a pair like a comedy team and afterone party our self parody of our own stammeringspeechlessness when introduced to henrik the swedish godauto mechanic our twin garish purple flowered swimsuitsfrom kmart outlining around texas our samenessand differences our dual waitressing shifts across town and the long phone calls that followed with their emphaticreiteration of every stingy six top ordering candy flavoredalcoholic drinks the after work visit where we brayed stomped then blinked stupidly while the needle hitthe lps end at the empty fifth of gin left on the coffee table prompting a dim uh oh your imitation of your mothershabitual and by the way inexplicable confession about youto shoe salesmen she has a funny foot the apartments the olivettis the boyfriends all the thoughts exchangedunedited like an experiment of the big walk in consciousness which we might have assumed the verbal equivalentof sex for friends and whatever closeness meant we wantedas much as we could have it was our post graduate workin the humanities even now i cant resist striking upa conversation while standing on line any line or introducingmyself enthusiastically to whomever i am introduced but the truth is i am not looking for new friends at this point i am trying to locate the lost ones the ones who leftthrough the hole of an argument decades ago a time more panicked and carefree than any other except maybethe early years of motherhood which i missed sharingwith you on playground benches but surely i will see youon the bus someday and your greeting will packageour jokes advice tears book talk our years of reliance and so i will expect you will tell me how much i havemisunderstood and wrongly assumed in these descriptions because i never expect those people who have matteredto remain completely gone even through death or rebuke and of course i have to remember what parted us that i found faults with your other friends that i spokeas critically and crassly about them as i did about my own person and to this day i have to be careful of that trait my junkyarddog of expression safe only with me on a too long leash here again telling you everything with no reason but formemorys insistence that i string an apology from what i see this is how it is with me so strong i want to draw the egg from your womb and nourish it in my own i want to mother your child made only of us of me you no borrowed seed from any man i want to re fashion the matrix of creation make a human being from the human love that passes between our bodies sweetheart this is how it is when you emerge from the bedroom in a clean cotton shirt sleeves pushed back over forearms scented with cologne from an amber bottle i want to open my heart the brightest aching slit of my soul receive your pearl i watch your hands wait for the sign that means youll touch me open me fill me wait for that moment when your desire leaps inside me i said love because it came closest said leave because you did we do this peeling off each from each each from suddenly other said come back but meant dont go i said dead and meant every one of those instances of vanishment how the dead swim away from us in time their tide their closed wooden boats i said tide but tide was never right said tide because we have no word for that kind of unforgiving away i said tether when i meant anchor when i meant stay but when i said stay one thing i meant was against confusion against yet another loss i meant two faced janus januarys god of fallen gates of trying to look both ways and when i said farewell i meant again dont go but it was too late i was here in the hall this tunnel full of mirrors glass and strange made up faces and when i thought funhouse i meant its opposite i meant this rusty carnival town the men so sad they paint their smiles in place they paint their faces white paint their eyes wide and full of crying are you shaken are you stirred by a whisper of love spellbound to a word does time cease to move till her calm grey eye expands to a sky and the clouds of her hair like storms go by then the lips that you have kissed turn to frost and fire and a white steaming mist obscures desire so back to their birth fade water air earth and the first power moves over void and dearth is that love no but death a passion a shout the deep in breath the breath roaring out and once that is flown you must lie alone without hope without life poor flesh sad bone when i first heard you on the phone your voice had to be that s wartime voice for it to get under my skin like it did after seven years asleep youre at the beginning of something you said and im at the end of something but you didnt go away twice born three times coming around rough cello late days i want to drive to your grave but i dont belong to it far from the tender tribe of boys remove for theyve a thousand ways to kindle love this pleases as he strides the managd horse and holds the taughtend rein with early force this as he swims delights thy fancy best raising the smiling wave with snowy breast this with a comely look and manly airs and that with virgin modesty ensnares but if at first you find him not inclind to love have patience time will change his mind and you whater your favrite does approve for condescension leads the way to love go with him where he goes tho long the way and the fierce dog star fires the sultry day or the gay rainbow girds the bluish sky and threatens rattling showrs of rain are nigh if sailing on the water by his will then steer the wherry with a dextrous skill nor think it hard fatigues and pains to bear but still be ready with a willing cheer if hell inclose the vales for savage spoils then on thy shoulders bear the nets and toils if fencing be the favrite sport hell use take up the files and artlessly oppose seem as intent yet oft expose your breast neglect your guard and let him get the best then hell be mild then you a kiss may seize hell struggle but at length comply with ease reluctant tho at first youll find him grow evn fond when round your neck his arms hell throw my darling turns to poetry at night what began as flirtation an aside between abstract expression and first light now finds form as a silent startled flight of commas on her face a breath a word my darling turns to poetry at night when rain inspires the night birds to create rhyme and formal verse stanzas can be made between abstract expression and first light her heartbeat is a metaphor a late bloom of red flowers that refuse to fade my darling turns to poetry at night i watch her turn i do not sleep i wait for symbols for a sign that fear has died between abstract expression and first light her dreams

juventutem meam gather you to me and to one another grind the time is come i must depart from thee ah famous city i never yet to rue my smart did find that thou hadst pity wherefore small cause there is that i should grieve from thee to go but many women foolishly like me and other moe do such a fix d fancy set on those which least deserve that long it is ere wit we get away from them to swerve but time with pity oft will tell to those that will her try whether it best be more to mell or utterly defy and now hath time me put in mind of thy great cruelness that never once a help would find to ease me in distress thou never yet wouldst credit give to board me for a year nor with apparel me relieve except thou pay d were no no thou never didst me good nor ever wilt i know yet am i in no angry mood but will or ere i go in perfect love and charity my testament here write and leave to thee such treasury as i in it recite now stand aside and give me leave to write my latest will and see that none you do deceive of that i leave them till souls joy bend not those morning stars from me where virtue is made strong by beautys might where love is chasteness pain doth learn delight and humbleness grows one with majesty whatever may ensue o let me be co partner of the riches of that sight let not mine eyes be hell drivn from that light o look o shine o let me die and see for though i

cruel shot a kind of grace it is to slay with speed the fist clenched round my heart loosens a little and i gasp brightness but it tightens again when have i ever not loved the pain of love but this has moved past love to mania this has the strong clench of the madman this is gripping the ledge of unreason before plunging howling into the abyss hold hard then heart this way at least you live the last line should strike like a lovers complaint you should never see it coming and you should never hear the end of it o that twere possible after long grief and pain to find the arms of my true love round me once again a shadow flits before me not thou but like to thee ah christ that it were possible for one short hour to see the souls we loved that they might tell us what and where they be in our old shipwrecked days there was an hour when in the firelight steadily aglow joined slackly we beheld the red chasm grow among the clicking coals our library bower that eve was left to us and hushed we sat as lovers to whom time is whispering from sudden opened doors we heard them sing the nodding elders mixed good wine with chat well knew we that lifes greatest treasure lay with us and of it was our talk ah yes love dies i said i never thought it less she yearned to me that sentence to unsay then when the fire domed blackening i found her cheek was salt against my kiss and swift up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift now am i haunted by that taste that sound in the northwest corner of dakota i saw a room someone had left a plush sofa returning its button eyed stare to the glance she gave it over her shoulder the dog too turning in the next room the mattress with mattress stories one after another tumbling out of each spring the window she opened first thing its vista of mile after mile and the windmill hauling its load i saw that and nothing alive green oil figured linoleum laid on counters nails of bad craft the ripped blackening edge that scared her more than the bed and the sound of the windmill winning its will from the aquifer night after night the whack of her blade on the block there are houses with too many knives sometimes she said but when june ferned its way in shed relent take on its restraint heave again on the stained sheets her burden of child herself a torn girl again combing her hair through fingers bruised by corn shocks sweet juice in the cuts of her life she began to think of the border and mustangs without brand at night theyd bend over the bed and nuzzle one ride was enough she had sufficient magic to cling to a mane and fare over the windowsill i see where the curtain fell and nobody mended the tear i see where bare feet marked like fossils her pass in the rain when he uncovers fiddleheads by the spring why does he always think of that first sight of her thigh in the peach colored dress of his hands searching moss with its red gold stamens the spring in that arid landscape like something from canaan under his tongue even in old age hed ponder the moment lying under the moon forgiving himself her the world that bred their conundrum washed in that rain i forgot how lush and electrified it was with you the shaggy fragrant zaps continually passing back and forth my fingertip to your clavicle or your wrist rubbing mine to share gardenia oil we so purred like dragonflies we kept the mosquitoes away and the conversation was heavy mother lacerated childhoods and the sad way wed both been both ignored and touched badly knowing that being fierce and proud and out and loud was just a bright new way to be needy please listen to me oh what a buzz youre the only one i can tell even with no secret i could come close to your ear with my mouth and that was ecstasy too we barely touched each other we didnt have to speak the love we made leapt to life like a cat in the space between us if there ever was space between us and looked back at us through fog sure this was san francisco it was often hard to see but fog always burned off too so we watched this creature to see if it knew what it was doing it didnt henry pulled our heartwood along the rutted street that town stood beside built two rooms and called them home my henry did that there and i lived all those days inside his love but there is a kind of hunger that feeds on flesh only let it be yearning heaving rising flesh only let it be flesh living and loving alive let it be life there is a kind of hunger that feeds on life they carved into him with banquet knives made stew of his skin and stirred it with his own bones my henry served the meat and the pot to cook it in and there was no charge against the men who made that meal he described her mouth as full of ashes so when he kissed her finally he was thinking about ashes and the blacker rim just below the edge of the ashtray and the faint dark rim that outlined her lips and the lips themselves at the limit of another darkness farther and far more interior then the way the red paling just outside those lines caught fire and the pages caught soon after that slowly at first but then all at once at the scalloped brown corners of each like the ruff of an offended and darkening bird extended then folded in on itself multiple stiffening gone i left my heart in the teeth of jumper cables black tongue superfluous nipples by the time i hit the yellow tape it was already turning red of my fair and alabaster love my redundant chains drawn in chalk halfway to the stars i stopped turned spat its too late baby how love came in i do not know whether by th eye or eare or no or whether with the soule it came at first infused with the same whether in part tis here or there or like the soule whole every where this troubles me but as i well as any other this can tell that when from hence she does depart the out let then is from the heart falling in love with a mustache is like saying you can fall in love with the way a man polishes his shoes which of course is one of the things that turns on my tuned up engine those trim buckled boots i feel like an advertisement for mens fashions when i think of your ankles yeats was hung up with a girls beautiful face and i find myself a bad moralist a failing aesthetician a sad poet wanting to touch your arms and feel the muscles that make a mans body have so much substance that makes a woman lean and yearn in that direction that makes her melt she is a rainy day in your presence the pool of wax under a burning candle the foam from a waterfall you are more beautiful than any harley davidson she is the rain waits in it for you finds blood spotting her legs from the long ride love is an interruption or an aberration a force in opposition to the ultimate inertia of the universe wrote marguerite duras whether or not it is worth it it occurs whether or not it is to be believed it is the wind moves us without a frond being needed to be held by a slave girl the rudiments of sentences are ancient without a mouth needing to remember what it is losing as it lets those words out something eviller than what they even mean right now something too evil to be known right now or ever i feel sure that even the most culpable people have other qualities secreted away adjusting their garments in light of fate he turned his head upward he looked up the white wall the light from the lamp could be light coming from a great distance it could be a great distance away and the wall could be snow it is so beautiful he said his head looking up the wall his eyes looking up it he said that nail in the wall could also be beautiful for so far away my weight is four whippets two chinese gymnasts half a shot putter it can be measured in bags of sugar jam jars enough feathers for sixty pillows or a ock of dead birds but some days its more than the house the span of blair athol road im the crooked spire warping itself doubled up over town i measure myself against the sky in its winter coat peat traces in water air locked in the radiators at night against my own held breath or your un nished sentences your hand on my back like a passenger touching the dashboard when a driver brakes as if they could slow things down i measure myself against love heavier lighter than both of us you must not wonder though you think it strange to see me hold my louring head so low and that mine eyes take no delight to range about the gleams which on your face do grow the mouse which once hath broken out of trap is seldom tic d with the trustless bait but lies aloof for fear of more mishap and feedeth still in doubt of deep deceit the scorch d fly which once hath scaped the flame will hardly come to play again with fire whereby i learn that grievous is the game which follows fancy dazzled by desire so that i wink or else hold down my head because your blazing eyes my bale have bred i thought i was so tough but gentled at your hands cannot be quick enough to fly for you and show that when i go i go at your commands even in flight above i am no longer free you seeled me with your love i am blind to other birds the habit of your words has hooded me as formerly i wheel i hover and i twist but only want the feel in my possessive thought of catcher and of caught upon your wrist you but half civilize taming me in this way through having only eyes for you i fear to lose i lose to keep and choose tamer as prey if youre loves lover and look for love cold smoke the dog called bashfulness beware for your conversation is a hindrancy this poem isnt interested ill bill you whyd the mad one make madness in a

when the come comes where does the pent go im done speak to me souls souls soul from desire of whom from whose desire every throat was cut we sat across the table he said cut off your hands they are always poking at things they might touch me i said yes food grew cold on the table he said burn your body it is not clean and smells like sex it rubs my mind sore i said yes i love you i said thats very nice he said i like to be loved that makes me happy have you cut off your hands yet fireplace blocked sealed withcardboard and taped furniture trashed paneling smashed on the second floormid

discovered without pick or ax i will be what brenda jones was stoned for in i saw it as a girl but didnt know i was taking in myself my hand remembers treading the watery room just behind the rose veiled eyes of memory alone in the yard tucked beneath the hood of her car lucky clover all about her feet green tea sweet necklace for her mud pie crusty work boots she fends off their spit words with silent two handed twists turns of her socket wrench a hurl of sticks stones and only me to whisper for her from sidewalk far break my bones a grown woman in grease pocket overalls inside her own sexy transmission despite the crowding of hurled red hots beneath the hood of her candy apple camaro souped shiny low to the ground the stars over the atlantic are dangling salt crystals the room at the seashell inn is a night special winter off season rate no one else here but us and the night clerk five floors below alone with his cherished stack of spiderman my lips are red snails in a primal search for every constellation hiding in the sky of your body my hand waits for permission for my life to agree to be changed forever can captain night clerk hear my fingers tambourining you there on the moon wont he soon climb the stairs and bam on the hood of this car you are a woman with film reels for eyes years of long talking have brought us to the land of the body our skin is one endless prayer bead of brown if my hand ever lands i will fly past dreaming australian aborigines the old claw hammer and monkey wrench that flew at brenda jones will fly across the yard of ocean at me a grease rag will be thrust into my painters pants against my will i will never be able to wash or peel any of this away before the night is over someone i do not know will want the keys to my silver thunderbird he will chase me down the street a gaggle of spooked hens will fly up in my grandmothers yard never to lay another egg just as i am jump ed kneed pulled finally to the high ground of sweet clover swung from the toes out belly breath riding on the knuckles the ten pound maul lifts up sails in an arc overhead and then lifts you it floats you float for an instant of clear far sight eye on the crack in the end grain angle of the oak round stood up to wait to be split the maul falls with a sigh the wood claps apart and lies twain in a wink as the maul splits all may you two stay together kissing the bankteller outside his stairs in brighton ma i cannot lie i felt the hope that we once felt if only for an instant o the lovely bankteller like a moose he rode my spirit quite outside my clothes and chrysanthemums sprouted i assure you out my nipples when he kissed them and the pureness of not knowing him at all was really what we all feel when we enter this earth there is a newness to the best things that cannot be excelled and old things like old love die and rot there are old ideas in the world that should be forgotten there are old ideas and old phrases that should at least be recycled for others there are old plans now that should be new there are old thoughts in your head my reader and let them die follow me i am the crusader of the new my spirit is a plastic rod that channels all our births and in the mouths of the little beasts we shall find the great ocean that spits up black bugs all glittering on its shores you know there is an anthem to the ages there is an anthem of the ages this is that anthem this is that anthem abandoned in a field near yass a cobwebbed car once kept us warm and when it rained though we shivered with sickness there came a moment of perfect happiness faces nestled in the vinyl sleep coming on surrounded by metal that in upcoming decades would oxidise to flakes asleep at last last of the valium we came to know a car too is a flower and pollen its decay in the dry air at dawn the cicadas kept still the space that mass sat in decided how mass was to move we dreamed of valleys of olive trees silver side out the lions preened we shivered with need a mechanic showed me once how the spark paths from spark plugs looked if you looked close enough like mountain ravines from the air the deeper the groove the faster the current we shivered this our habit this flowing it takes the breath away there are gum trees crackling from it two decades later i slept so still beneath that mass of dreams like sediment compressed beneath a lake i woke and the tributes and glory were gone and the crops all withered and money was merely the index of anxiety when we realised this our hearts swelled in exultation even time would forget there was reason for fear that decay seemed to will itself upon us i was off the air delirious with substance the kite hawks grew ashamed all nature squirmed i was off the air light headed with voracity the theme just kept repeating itself year in year out same demon different bodies a nurse said when you stay when you leave those wet imprints in our airspace these sheets smell like formaldehyde like death we had merely reached early down the end of the river the leprosarium of feeling and all things stood for every other thing creepers vines tendrils anacondas inert surrender such listlessness and yes the very rage with which we chased the very forms of it the lineaments of nothingness the powders of the comatose the bliss this was the state of the world heading backwards we learned the flea fish was the smallest animal before the insect kingdom began forwards there were only the sudden deaths of galaxies and yet when we practised love there seemed on certain days an awful lot of space and so much sky never had i lain then at kangaroo valley so comfortable in my own body a virtual flatness and that centrifuge in the stomach stilled and my spine a spirit level the smell of coffee drifting in brought back to me that lily white girl and that sad hour of need how brittle every bone was then how could one not be completely bedraggled by time or compulsion or duplicity i was all those things and am i was so tired with the not being here inside of it all that fatigue was like oxygen given of all the givens sensurround of the gods but i was gulping and

cross legs cross deserts always pause just moments before he it was twilight all day sometimes the smallest things weigh us down small stones that we cant help admiring and palming look at the tiny way this lighter vein got inside look at the heavy gray dome of its sky this is no immutable world we know less than its atoms rushing through light light light as air to them for all we know trust me on this one there is happiness at stake boulder grain planet dust what fills the stones fills us i remember or i have a feeling i could be living somewhere with you weighted down the way we arent now

love thee still my dear while the sands o life shall run and fare thee weel my only luve and fare thee weel awhile and i will come again my luve though it were ten thousand mile not embittered even while freezing to the ice of their own lakes the night i was leaving for madrid into the noisy party a dazzling friend of a friend walked in i want so much as a couple of kids on the dance floor want to slow the tempo hold there longer to feel that seedly longing to be pressed into the soil or that little lift the mothers get when stocking larders even now vestige of the primitive urge to be provided for and to provide i went alone to see that balcony in verona after the roman dramas and luxuries above the spanish steps when an elegant footman brought a pack of reds on a silver tray and all but smoked them for you after your towels had warmed in londons best hotel whose name i cant remember and am kind of glad glad now for the rest of empty august and the convent hostels eleven oclock curfew glad now when i go to the distinguished dinners that i have stood alone wondering at illuminated books looking at woolfs spectacles under glass or standing under bourgeoiss giant spider at the tate at times the best kept universe was my own no interceding docents or guided tours but a riverine serendipitous wandering waif na f i liked the light enormously so why did i obey the bell that called me in deathbed there is a word that is not water has nothing to do with heat or light is unrelated to any one pain though the torn body tears itself further trying to speak it there is a sound beyond all the sounds that i have made the needs that one by one ive tried to name it burns clear in the eyes searching mine the lips beginning to bleed again her hand squeezing my hand pleading and pleading that i understand living will all afternoon in the afterlife of little things that love or pain or need could not let go of i hunt for the will that will let me let you go i am distracted and slow all the grainy faces in old photographs letters from the dead deeds to places that are only air some bright nowhere of broad fields and sunlight that was my idea of heaven one long afternoon of clouds and steady rain when you sat and explained where a garden was a well excited by it the hell ahead of you just a brief tightness at your heart outside in the yard crickets start cry here and here and here nights thousand shadows growing tall and now i have it formal final i touch each keepsake like a wall going in the hard light and hum of the room to which ive come to stay i watch the clock and wait and hour by hour begin to disappear movements mutterings the brain darkens like a landscape pain in the pale arterial hills flashes and vanishes takes with it one whole year cotton and killdeer a cloud looks down somethings happened in the wellhouse someone runs through tall trees breathe and breathe is it my hand you hold the fever climbs you grow cold then warm now cold again a hive of nerves in the skin some glimmer breaks through and i bend whispering as fear like a wind shakes you im right here im right here midnight moonlight gauzing the walls the iron and umber of intensive care i watch as it swells and falls the puttied scar at your heart and read each beat and falter on a screen and match my breathing to the breathing of a machine to know this time as it passes each moment as it goes until early you shudder and quieten blood gases begin to rapidly rise and somewhere behind your eyes i fall in fragments away a child surprised at his play encroached upon by air a shattered man near dawn something about the way he holds so still his hair as some fond virgin whom her mothers care drags from the town to wholesome country air just when she learns to roll a melting eye and hear a spark yet think no danger nigh from the dear man unwillingly she must sever yet takes one kiss before she parts for ever thus from the world fair zephalinda flew saw others happy and with sighs withdrew not that their pleasures caused her discontent she sighed not that they stayed but that she went she went to plain work and to purling brooks old fashioned halls dull aunts and croaking rooks she went from opera park assembly play to morning walks and prayers three hours a day to pass her time twixt reading and bohea to muse and spill her solitary tea or oer cold coffee trifle with the spoon count the slow clock and dine exact at noon divert her eyes with pictures in the fire hum half a tune tell stories to the squire up to her godly garret after seven there starve and pray for thats the way to heaven some squire perhaps you take a delight to rack whose game is whisk whose treat a toast in sack who visits with a gun presents you birds then gives a smacking buss and cries no words or with his hound comes hollowing from the stable makes love with nods and knees beneath a table whose laughs are hearty tho his jests are coarse and loves you best of all things but his horse in some fair evening on your elbow laid your dream of triumphs in the rural shade in pensive thought recall the fancied scene see coronations rise on every green before you pass th imaginary sights of lords and earls and dukes and gartered knights while the spread fan oershades your closing eyes then give one flirt and all the vision flies thus vanish scepters coronets and balls and leave you in lone woods or empty walls so when your slave at some dear idle time not plagued with headaches or the want of rhyme stands in the streets abstracted from the crew and while he seems to study thinks of you just when his fancy points your sprightly eyes or sees the blush of soft parthenia rise gay pats my shoulder and you vanish quite streets chairs and coxcombs rush upon my sight vexed to be still in town i knit my brow look sour and hum a tune as you may now a hole is nothing but what remains around it my brother stood in the refrigerator light drinking milk that poured out of his head through thick black curls down his back into a puddle growing larger around him my body stood between the living room and kitchen one foot on worn carpet one on cold linoleum he couldnt hear his name clouding from my mouth settling in the fluorescent air i wanted to put my finger into the hole feel the smooth channel he escaped through stop the milk so he could swallow it but my body held as if driven into place the milk on the floor reflected the light then became it floated upward and outward filling every shadow blowing the dark open cain tended to break rules and

lusting after her theyre imbeciles this was gruesome fighting over a ham sandwich with one of the tiny cats of rome he leaped on my arm and half hung on to the food and half hung on to my shirt and coat i tore it apart and let him have his portion i think i lifted him down sandwich and all on the sidewalk and sat with my own sandwich beside him maybe i petted his bony head and felt him shiver i have told this story over and over some things root in the mind his boldness of course was frightening and unexpected his stubbornness though hunger drove him mad it was the breaking of boundaries the sudden invasion but not only that it was the sharing of food and the sharing of space he didnt run into an alley or into a cellar he sat beside me eating and i didnt run into a trattoria say shaking with food on my lips and blood on my cheek sobbing but not only that i had gone there to eat and wait for someone i had maybe an hour before she would come and i was full of hope and excitement i have resisted for years interpreting this but now i think i was given a clue or i was giving myself a clue across the street from the glass sandwich shop that was my last night with her the next day i would leave on the train for paris and she would meet her husband thirty five years ago i ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms we were dying together we never met again although she was pregnant when i left her i have a daughter or son somewhere darling grandchildren in norwich connecticut or canton ohio every five years i think about her again and plan on looking her up the last time i was sitting in new brunswick new jersey and heard that her husband was teaching at princeton if she was still married or still alive and tried calling i went that far we lived in florence and rome we rowed in the bay of naples and floated naked on the boards i started to think of her again today i still am horrified by the cats hunger i still am puzzled by the connection this is another insane devotion there must be hundreds although it isnt just that there is no pain and the thought is fleeting and sweet i think its my own dumb boyhood walking around with slavic cheeks and burning stupid eyes i think i gave the cat half of my sandwich to buy my life i think i broke it in half as a decent sacrifice it was this i bought the red coleus the split rocking chair the silk lampshade happiness i watched him with pleasure i bought memory i could have lost it how crazy it sounds his face twisted with cunning the wind blowing through his hair his jaw working all the angels of tie siding were on fire the famous sky was gone presumably the mountains were still there invisible in haze ok there was only one angel but she was a torch in the wind beside the wind ripped american flag the post office flies ok she wasnt literally on fire maybe her angelic red hair made me think she was ablaze as it flaunted the prairie and made a festival of itself there was a fireworks stand nearby entirely beside the point as was the fourth of july it was really dry it was fire season it was the wind festival featuring an angel standing in it letting her red hair conflagrate history reduce it to ash bid it start anew erase the sky with atrocitys own smoke she wore besides her flame of hair blue jeans and a singlet she was violent in the wind i started walking toward her im still walking toward her no idea what to say when i get there dost see how unregarded now that piece of beauty passes there was a time when i did vow to that alone but mark the fate of faces the red and white works now no more on me than if it could not charm or i not see and yet the face continues good and i have still desires am still the selfsame flesh and blood as apt to melt and suffer from those fires oh some kind powr unriddle where it lies whether my heart be faulty or her eyes she evry day her man does kill and i as often die neither her power then nor my will can questiond be what is the mystery sure beautys empires like to greater states have certain periods set and hidden fates i when his dogs leapt on actaeon he cried did he cry out he flung his arm to command they tore his hand from the wrist stump tore guts from his belly through the tunic ripped the cry from his throat thats how we know a god when the facts leap at the tenderest innards and we know the god is what we cant change you stood over me as i woke i opened my eyes i saw that id seen and that it was too late the seeing of you in the doorway with weak electric light fanning behind you in the hall and my room and narrow pallet steeped in shadow were what i couldnt change and distantly i wanted you and as distantly i heard the dogs baying ii and yet the fountain spends itself and it is in the clear light of its losing that we seem to take delight you dipped your hand in its running braid to sprinkle my forehead my lips garden deities observed us three nymphs with moss staining their haunches a pug nosed faun the wound in water closed perfectly around your gesture erasing it so that only the glimmer swiftly drying on my face recalled our interruption of the faultless cold passionate perpetual idea of the streams descent which unlike ours would always be renewed iii i kissed a flame what did i expect those days you painted in fire tangerine gold one would have had to be a pilgrim to walk through that wall of molten glass and purification could be conceived if not attained only after many years in autumn in a fire greater than yours though menstrual blood still tinged the threshold and our ex votos were sordid scraps of blistered flesh taped to kitsch prayer cards and neither of us knew the object of this exercise except having inadvertently each of us burned we recognized the smell of wood smoke the slow swirl flakes of wood ash make in heavy air and we were ready each in a private way to make the gifts the season required mine was the scene of my young self in your arms eyes in your eyes clutched in the effort to give each other away when i glimpsed behind your pleasure fear behind fear anger and knew in a bolt some gifts conceal a greater gift i have kept it now i am ready to give it back into darker flame in this season of goldenrod the ardent weed and queen annes lace in its mantilla of ash and yet how lumpishly how stupidly i stand how much that is human will never burn iv and if you should answer i listened years before i knew you to the whine of wind through the high stony pastures above my childhood village i breathed lavender and thyme and burned my bare legs on nettles scraped them on thistles and rubbed the sore skin till it reddened all the more when we walked the uplands together you burned your hand and i kissed the crimsoning nettle rash we are the lords of need you said hafiz said and i believed you and we were in the rugs of your country carmine is crushed from insects cochineal saffron gold is boiled from crocus stamens and indigo of heaven and fountain pools is soaked hours upon hours from indigo leaves like the angel harut you said we are in the calamity of love desire the angel is chained by neck and knees head down in the pit of babel for falling in love your carpets told a different story scarlet and saffron blush as in paradise and god reveals himself in wine flame tulips and the light in a mortal eye all night you held me sleepless on my childhood cot in the stone house all night the wind seethed through crags and twisted olive trees high on the scents of thyme and goat droppings all night hafiz sang i hope the breeze of dawn will cherish the lovers but the breeze of dawn is the angel of death you are in your far landscape now i am in mine the wind complains and i cant understand the words and if you should answer you ten years away in a different wind we are in the calamity hafiz sang but tell the tale of the minstrel and of wine and leave time alone time is a mystery no skill will solve we should thread words like pearls you said and the grateful sky would scatter the pleiades upon us though we couldnt see and that was long ago v the carpet is not a story it is a place garden of crisscrossed pathways labyrinth fountain pool and stream as though the fabric had ripped at the vanishing point at the top of the street of ashen fa ades and slate sloped roofs you stepped through the gap out of your own world i had already lost my world we met in a torn design which we tore further pulling the tall warp thread wrapped tightly around our fingers until it bit the flesh and the rue de lille unravelled i know about design its my job arranging other peoples letters in star charts that phosphoresce in the dark between the closed covers of books you knew about design from the holes blown through your country we spoke in a language of no country on earth you moved slowly in shadow teaching the shadows to echo my name you ripped my shirt at the neck was it the beloved i held holding you down the middle of the carpet the river weaves a thousand gray glimmers into the deeper green the river knows about mourning thats its job how many years has it practiced with such fleet fingers a man woke me at dawn this morning sobbing and cursing in the street reeling from sidewalk to gutter and back again on my long gray street the rue de lille where i still live even before i saw the chambered nautilus i wanted to sail not in the us navy tonight im waiting for you your letter at the same time his letter the view of you by him and then by me in the park no rhymes i saw you this is in prose no its not sitting with the molluscs anemones in an empty autumn enterprise baby you look pretty with your long eventual hair is love king whats this a sonnet loves a babe we know that im coming up im coming shakespeare only stuck to one subject but ill mention nobody said you have to get young americans some ice cream in the artificial light in which she woke and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay for shame to save thee from the blameof all my grief and grame and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay and wilt thou leave me thus that hath loved thee so longin wealth and woe among and is thy heart so strongas for to leave me thus say nay say nay and wilt thou leave me thus that hath given thee my heartnever for to depart nother for pain nor smart and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay and wilt thou leave me thusand have no more pityof him that loveth thee h las thy cruelty and wilt thou leave me thus say nay say nay you are the problem i propose my dear the text my musings glose i call you for convenience love by definition youre a cause inferred by necessary laws you are so to the saints above but in this shadowy lower life i sleep with a terrestrial wife and earthy children i beget love is a fiction i must use a privilege i can abuse and sometimes something i forget now in the heavenly other place love is in the eternal mind the luminous form whose shade she is a ghost discarnate thought defined she was so to my early bliss she is so while i comprehend the forms my senses apprehend and in the end she will be so her whom my hands embrace i kiss her whom my mind infers i know the one exists in time and space and as she was she will not be the other is in her own grace and is she is eternally plato you shall not plague my life i married a terrestrial wife and hume she is not mere sensation in sequence of observed relation she has two forms ah thank you duns i know her in both ways at once i knew her yes before i knew her and by both means i must construe her and none among you shall undo her it was as if her love had become a big eye or some historical logic or a religious particle lodged in the brain in the most costly services of a great society one may find the allure of a benign intelligence i have hoped since i was a child to be surrounded by a group of articulate characters who might with gracious friendship provide some essential entertainment as aarons which was a cane and then a snake and then a cane again great clouds of smoke from the forest itsy bugs amarch my naked legs in my beard to burn as one might with ones eyes i learned but can no longer remember with what dignity anothers care imbues one you sit and pick the lice from my hair what sort of life is this i hubbie used to get wholly pissed when i made myself come im right here hed sputter blood popping to the surface of his fuzzed cheeks goddamn it im right here by that time i was in no mood to discuss the myriad merits of my pointer or to jam the brakes on the express train slicing through my blood it was easier to suffer the practiced professorial huff the hissed invectives and the cold old shoulder liver dotted quaking with rage shall we pause to bless professors and codgers and their bellowed unquestioned ownership of things i was sneaking time with my own body i know i signed something over but it wasnt that ii no matter how i angle this history its weird so lets just say bringing up baby was on the telly and suddenly my lips pressing against the couch cushions felt spectacular and i thought wow this is strange what the hell im years old am i dying down there is this the feel does the cunt go to heaven first ooh snapped river ooh shimmy i had never had it never knew oh i clamored and lurched beneath my little succession of boys i cried writhed hissed ooh wee suffered their flat lapping and machine gun diddling their insistent cmon girl cmon until i memorized the blueprint for drawing blood from their shoulders until there was nothing left but the self satisfied liquidy snore of he who has rocked she he who has made she weep with script but this oh cary gee katherine hallelujah baby the fur do fly all gush and kaboom on the wind iii dont hate me because i am multiple hurtling as long as there is still skin on the pad of my finger as long as im awake as long as my new husbands mouth holds out i am the spinner the unbridled the bellowing freak when i have emptied him he leans back coos edges me along keeps wondering count he falls to his knees in front of it marvels at my yelps and carousing spine stares unflinching as i bleed spittle unto the pillows he has married a witness my body bucks slave to its selfish engine and love is the dim miracle of these little deaths fracturing speeding for the surface iv we know the record as it taunts us we have giggled considered stopwatches little laboratories somewhere beneath the suffering clean swathed in eyes and silver she came times in one hour i imagine wires holding her tight her throat a rattling window searching scrubbed places for her name i find only reams of numbers i ask the quietest of them v are we god oh raphael guardian angel in love and crime all things move in sevens seven compartments in the heart the seven elaborate temptations seven devils cast from mary magdalene whore of christ the seven marvelous voyages of sinbad sin bad and the number seven branded forever on the forehead of cain the first inspired man the father of desire and murder but his was not the first ecstasy consider his mother eves was the crime of curiosity as the saying goes it killed the pussy one bad apple spoiled the whole shot but be sure it was no apple an apple looks like an ass its fags fruit it must have been a tomato or better yet a mango she bit must we blame her abuse her poor sweet bitch perhaps theres more to the story think of satan as some stud maybe her knees were open satan snakes between them they open wider snakes up her thighs rubs against her for a while more than the tree of knowledge was about to be eaten she shudders her first shudder pleasure pleasure garden was she sorry are we ever girls was she a good lay god only knows at supper he whispers something in your ear the judas boy who wants you we go to the garden where its cool and wait from my place against the tree i see you through the window watch as you walk from door to desk reach into your pocket pull out your wallet empty it and leave it by the lamp pick up a pen lean over to write then dont take something heavy from the drawer put it back then sweep the money into a paper bag you walk from desk to door and out your hand reaching back to put out the light on the security film you leave the building alone holding the heavy bag off camera you walk towards the charles leave your saddle shoes under the pedestrian bridge we wait in the garden and wait we dont know yet whom you meet or why we dont know yet that the river has claimed you i couldnt see in this light even if i wished the black grillwork over black cool upon coal kisses me back in an icy press not wanting anything but to fall as the empty trash cans mingle below with the smell of feral cats flailing moon the color of suds over this factory of artifice moored in the poverty of my untouched element downed like a dog struck by a diesel one headlamp flaring before my shadows dust buries its past in a crescent of mirth lost now in this anonymity of barely knowing you my body would go unsearched for in the rubble who could remember my odor my perfect strangeness at a glance life leaves through the gate of an ache where you are a vanishing landscape do i dare it back i dont know where you go anymore when you escape into that vast wilderness of our legal separation your memory rises from the knocking pipes a sudden heat a blast of blood where does it go the galloping horses i hear are not hooves but my heart kicking in its swollen stall but you you take things as a letting go like a beacon that opens a lens cap to our past you take off the dark like this snow strewn alley a radiance but no light of mine jealous as an abandoned child i had no word for father it floated in heaven like friend or famine it rose like a muscle and punctuated my dreams the ones of ruined houses of countries like this one where the faces of whores and the working poor are my own you had irish eyes the color of old ice what you lost was first love and a word for forever like evergreen oceanic fossil my bones could grind themselves to salt and i would still be this aging woman this battered lifeline history never has been kind to a loser what do i see when morning chops ice into jade what ring could i trade now for the freedom to bleed what would i remember of a hearth where the flags of my silks beat at half mast where i studied a sure vocabulary of snow i had to leave before i could hear it the sound of dishwater in a steamed house the singing of water on white porcelain cooling like clots seeping through a wound our collision of tensions a viscous rendered fat divorced releasing i realise its not all salad sandwiches at pinewood picnics endless volleyball ive heard the argument that talk of shame and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty how weve all got one seen one seen em all but its not for me beneath my double load of calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies for me i have to see the clothes come off the way a buttons thumbed through cotton cloth a winning move in some exotic game with no set rules but countless permutations or how a summer dress falls to the floor with momentary mass and with a plash that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip three fingertips that follow down the spine to where a clasp is neatly spun undone amidkiss by prime legerdemain and who cares that it happens once in four and never never on the first undressing it must be better than a foreskin snagged on gorse thorns or a cold fat nipple jammed in the scissor drawer the bounty and the blessing the mystery of nakedness reduced till on a par with go go palaces where goosebumped grinding strippers strut their stuff in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses down on a par with the oncologist who gropes for lumps the night morgue man who clips his nails amongst the naked bin bagged stiffs so stranger what i want to say is this if youre to join me in a little sinning and this is my place up here on the right please understand id value some reluctance a cold feet shiver as in the beginning when eve discovered modesty and slipped in and out of something comfortable for there are many ways to skin a cat but ours is human nature things come off so rarely come in let me take your coat they have shown her facing from a range of barley at times and from the patio she wrings a sprig of mint in a walled garden behold the dimple that none reckoned on careless burdens of plums of parsley i thank those gentlemen many an old master is needed if there shall be love i thank velasquez more for a woman turned away may be imposed without disparagement in a prospect of grandeur where this high cliff joins the deep sunlight i see you beside me spread aside in the buoyant deer moss i sit cross legged nibbling juniper berries and i call you my louella now now ella lou far down from one rim is the bay with flocks of teal and we might look down shafts of cedar the other way i feel a privileged one who waits remembering the special pleasure of youth is of self denial since velasquez and the masters have hexed my eyes i see you now even in this northern grandeur following the hip i watch the flanks retirement and watch the nape declining from the crescent shoulder but where your shoulder ripples back to fill the arm is a slight plump area probably nameless in all but rarest postures that form vanishes into wherever you withdraw inopportune breaths you might not wonder it is there i stretching forward beseeching you be motionless hold the wide kiss i wonder mightily for my part for what purpose have i stretched a thousand miles between the two of us when i say pre exposure prophylaxis you thinkeasy fix greek in origin an act of guarding east of here a small temple inside parishioners strip nudeas armless statues their stonegenitals hardening under a chemists glare the garden out front fecund tended the garden inside bare when i say tenofovir disoproxil you thinkchemical names saint names names without origin an unpronounceable string of letters the generic namesof petty angels the drugs molecular makeup applied in around the eyes lips the names of viruses blind trials the kept vial of love the unknowable side effects of blood when i say oral emtricitabine you

epidemicyou push the blue pill through its foilyou know each new medicine trailsour dead behind it like wedding canslistenyou can hear them now cant you that linkage of warnings sent a tremor through june as if to prepare october in the hardest apples one week in late july we held hands through the bars of his hospital bed our sleep made a canopy over us and it seemed i heard its durable roaring in the companion sleep of what must have been our bedouin god and now when the poppy lets go i know it is to lay bare his thickly seeded black coach at the pinnacle of dying my shaggy ponies heard the shallow snapping of silk but grazed on down the hillside their prayer flags tearing at the void what we stared into its cool flux of blue and white how just shaking at flies they sprinkled the air with the soft unconscious praise of bells braided into their manes my life simplified to for him and his thinned like an injection wearing off so the real gave way to the more than real each moments carmine abundance furl of reddest petals lifted from the stalk and no hint of the black hussars hat at the center by then his breathing stopped so gradually i had to brush lips to know an ending tasting then that plush of scarlet which is the last of warmth kissless kiss he would have given mine to extend a lovers right past its radius to give and also most needfully my gallant hussar to bend and take if by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck in your heel the wetness of a finished lollipop stick the surprise of a thumbtack in your purse then yes every last page is true every nuance bit and bite wait i have made them up all of them and when i say i am married it means i marriedall of them a whole neighborhood of past loves can you imagine the number of bouquets how many slices of cake even now my husbands plan a great meal for us one chops up some parsley one stirs a bubbling pot on the stove one changes the baby and one sleeps in a fat chair one flips through the newspaper another whistles while he shaves in the shower and every single one of them wonders what time i am coming home some folks fool themselves into believing but i know what i know once at the height of hopeless touching my man and i holdour breaths certain we can stop time or maybeeliminate it from our lives which are shorter since we learned to make love for each other rather than doing it to each other as for praise and worship i prefer the latter only memorymakes us kneel silent and still hear me thunder scares lightning lets us see then heads covered we wait for rain dear lord let me watch for his arrival and hang my headand shake it like a man whos lost and lived something keeps trying but im not killed yet the paper table cloth was tastefully bleak the misty morning light shone on his cheek and made him look alone and masculine he talked of seneca and bad translations of modern critics lightweight observations a bread crumb rested sweetly on his chin behind him through the glass the oceans heave uncurled against the sand beside his sleeve as eros aimed his toxic javelin i ducked out of the way to no avail it glanced my flesh injecting quite a cocktail that blurred my sight and caused my head to spin never mind the coffee we were drinking whatever i said was not what i was thinking i wanted to become his mandolin and lie across his lap a dainty lute and sing to him and feed him ripened fruit while light upon the sea turned opaline instead this conversation about art and formal education god hes smart such rationality should be a sin the hour was up he had to run of course a handshake and a peck of shy remorse outside the sea was gray and dull as tin it ruled the shore with tedious discipline give me hunger o you gods that sit and give the world its orders give me hunger pain and want shut me out with shame and failure from your doors of gold and fame give me your shabbiest weariest hunger but leave me a little love a voice to speak to me in the day end a hand to touch me in the dark room breaking the long loneliness in the dusk of day shapes blurring the sunset one little wandering western star thrust out from the changing shores of shadow let me go to the window watch there the day shapes of dusk and wait and know the coming of a little love the sleep of this night deepens because i have walked coatless from the house carrying the white envelope all night it will say one name in its little tin house by the roadside i have raised the metal flag so its shadow under the roadlamp leaves an imprint on the rain heavy bushes now i will walk back thinking of the few lights still on in the town a mile away in the yellowed light of a kitchen the millworker has finished his coffee his wife has laid out the white slices of bread on the counter now while the bed they have left is still warm i will think of you you who are so far away you have caused me to look up at the stars tonight they have not moved from childhood those games played after dark again i walk into the wet grass toward the starry voices again i am the found one intimate returned by all i touch on the way i am hoping to hang your head on my wall in shame the slightest taxidermy thrills me fish forever leaping on the living room wall paperweights made from skulls of small animals i want to wear your smile on my sleeve break your heart like a horse or its leg weeks of being bucked off then all at once youre mine put me down i want to call you thine to tattoo mercy along my knuckles i assassindown the avenue i hope to have you forgotten by noon to know you by your knees palsied by prayer loneliness is a science consider the taxidermists tender hands trying to keep from losing skin the bobcat grin of the living when i have fears that i may cease to be before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain before high pil d books in charactery hold like rich garners the full ripened grain when i behold upon the nights starred face huge cloudy symbols of a high romance and think that i may never live to trace their shadows with the magic hand of chance and when i feel fair creature of an hour that i shall never look upon thee more never have relish in the faery power of unreflecting love then on the shore of the wide world i stand alone and think till love and fame to nothingness do sink its more than silhouettes tonight every window in the city lit shades lifted curtains open as one suspected the dark buildings full of lovers undressing beneath light bulbs before mirrors men women men men women women embracing even the loners visible flickered by single candles touching places theyve usually chosen to keep secret so much nakedness and the streets empty except for the newsboys moving through shadows leafless trees snatching underclothes out of wind the el clattering above the roofs like a strip of blue movie you politely ask me not to die and i promise not to right from the beginning a relationship based on good sense and thoughtfulness in little things i would like to be loved for such simple attainments as breathing regularly and not falling down too often or because my eyes are brown or my father left handed and to be on the safe side i wouldnt mind if somehow i became entangled in your perception of admirable objects so you might say to yourself i have recently noticed how superbly situated the empire state building is how it looms up suddenly behind cemeteries and rivers so far away you could touch it therefore i love you part of me fears that some moron is already plotting to tear down the empire state building and replace it with a block of staten island mother daughter houses just as part of me fears that if you love me for my cleanliness i will grow filthy if you admire my elegant clothes ill start wearing shirts with sailboats on them but i have decided to become a public beach an opera house a regularly scheduled flight something that cant help being in the right place at the right time come take your seat well raise the curtain fill the house start the engines fly off into the sunrise the spire of the empire state the last sight on the horizon as the earth begins to curve i love you as a sheriff searches for a walnut that will solve a murder case unsolved for years because the murderer left it in the snow beside a window through which he saw her head connecting with her shoulders by a neck and laid a red roof in her heart for this we live a thousand years for this we love and we live because we love we are not inside a bottle thank goodness i love you as a kid searches for a goat i am crazier than shirttails in the wind when youre near a wind that blows from the big blue sea so shiny so deep and so unlike us i think i am bicycling across an africa of green and white fields always to be near you even in my heart when im awake which swims and also i believe that you are trustworthy as the sidewalk which leads me to the place where i again think of you a new harmony of thoughts i love you as the sunlight leads the prow of a ship which sails from hartford to miami and i love you best at dawn when even before i am awake the sun receives me in the questions which you always pose in the clear light that confuses everything only you dark laurel shadow my house lifting your arms in the anguish of nature at the stake and at night quivering with tears you are like the tree called tassos crippled and hooped with iron it stands on peters hill when the lovers prop their bicycles and sit on the high benches that look across to eternity that tree makes their own torsion seem natural and so theyre comforted one of the local philosophers he says in california we have the old anarchist tradition what can he mean is there an anarchist tradition and why would an anarchist want one o california is there a tree without opinions come let me clasp you let me feel the idea breathing i too cry o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts the sayling pine the cedar proud and tall like the girls in our neighborhood theyre beautiful and silent as i was digging in the back yard i thought of a man in china a lifetime it seemed we gazed at each other i could see and hear his heartbeats like a spade hurling clods he pointed behind him and i saw that the hills were covered with armed men and they were all on the other side of the life that i held dear he said we are as various as the twigs of a tree but now the tree moves as one man it walks and the earth trembles when a race of slaves is leaving i said yet all these people will fall down as one man when the entrails of a bomb are breathing when we came down from chosin carrying the guns in dainty snow wear and all the dead we had to it was a time of forgetfulness like a plucked string it was a river of darkness was it not so on your side when you came to the sea that was covered with ships let us speak to each other let the word rise making dark strokes in the air that bird flies over the heads of the armed men one part of the tree grows outward the other i saw when with a light i explored the cellar shattering roots they had broken through the wall as though there were something in my rubbish that life would have at last i must be patient with shapes of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles these things are the beginning of things not visible to the naked eye it was so in the time of tobit the dish glowed when the angel held it it is so that spiritual messengers deliver their meaning two guys sucking each other in the steam room didnt want anything to do with me evidently i left them to their comedy legato longings wish for walnuts wish for water wish to exorcise this mornings debauch two faur nocturnes in slow motion steve tussled with a motorcycle trying to run me over on the boulevard of moon smut splicing together bridges and lagoons like the bride of frankenstein rushing to overtake the inert real a mass of facts some conjugal some comic contrapuntal tenebrae sing lullaby as women do wherewith they bring their babes to rest and lullaby can i sing too as womanly as can the best with lullaby they still the child and if i be not much beguiled full many wanton babes have i which must be stilled with lullaby first lullaby my youthful years it is now time to go to bed for crooked age and hoary hairs have won the haven within my head with lullaby then youth be still with lullaby content thy will since courage quails and comes behind go sleep and so beguile thy mind next lullaby my gazing eyes which wonted were to glance apace for every glass may now suffice to show the furrows in my face with lullaby then wink awhile with lullaby your looks beguile let no fair face nor beauty bright entice you eft with vain delight and lullaby my wanton will let reasons rule now reign thy thought since all too late i find by skill how dear i have thy fancies bought with lullaby now take thine ease with lullaby thy doubts appease for trust to this if thou be still my body shall obey thy will eke lullaby my loving boy my little robin take thy rest since age is cold and nothing coy keep close thy coin for so is best with lullaby be thou content with lullaby thy lusts relent let others pay which hath mo pence thou art too poor for such expense thus lullaby my youth mine eyes my will my ware and all that was i can no mo delays devise but welcome pain let pleasure pass with lullaby now take your leave with lullaby your dreams deceive and when you rise with waking eye remember then this lullaby because yosemites high altitude lakes tadpoles wash up in glow in the dark condoms and every fish lip has a hook in it because theres bird shit in the clouds things catch get caught things are consumed theres no looking back and so you were conceived here ezekiel fifty feet off the trail of broken ankles we wanted to make sure no one would see the one hiker who saw looked away amino acids of the flushed cheek dirge for eyeless things i washed my body in the river and the river went numb the mind sunburned i imagine the second before you took before the cells began to split before that flint was struck before the dna began to twist that a colorless emptiness suddenly inverted and told the world that he too once had a mother but there is no nest of leaves nothing stops the clock in the glacier still ticks above us and on our skin there were enormous ants the segments of their bodies like black droplets of paint pushed very close against each other but still not touching yet taking their work with them taking away their dirt world you love apples so lets speak of applessay i were to hold you in my hand like an apple round and redand kiss you in bites on the table orunder the tree where you dropped tumpand you reached up in cool shadow on the grassand bit back crunch godid laugh knowing dreamsask like this swallow by swallow a man can give up so much can limit himself to handwritten correspondence to foods made of whole grains to heat from a woodstove logs hewn by his own hand and stacked neatly like corpses by the backdoor he can play nocturnes by heart they will not make the beloved appear he can learn the names of all the birds in the valley not one will be enticed to learn his these creatures of the languid orient rare pearls of caste in their voluptuous swoonand gilded ease by eunuchs watched and pent and doomed to hear the lutes perpetual tune were passions toys to lust an ornament but not such was our thrush voiced octoroon the southland beauty who was wont to hearfaiths tender secrets whispered in her ear an honest mans the noblest work of no that threadbare old mistake ill not repeat a lovely woman do you not think so is gods best work that she is mans helpmeet the bible says and i will let it go and yet she crowns and makes his life complete who would not shrive himself in her dear face and find his sinless heaven in her embrace young maury loved his slave she was his own a gift for all he questioned from the skies not other fortune had he ever known like that which sparkled in her wild blue eyes her seal brown locks and cheeks like roses blown were wealth to him that een the gods might prize and when her slender waist to him he drew the sum of every earthly bliss he knew they had grown up together he and she a world unto themselves all else was bare a desert to them and an unknown sea their lives were like the birds lives free and fair and flowed together like a melody they could not live apart ah silly pair but since she was his slave what need to say a swarm of troubles soon beset their way just in the dawn of blushing womanhood her swan neck glimpsed through shocks of wavy hair a hint of olives in her gentle blood suggesting passion in a rosy lair this shapely venus of the cabins stood in all but birth a princess tall and fair and is it any wonder that this braveand proud young master came to love his slave if it be shame to love a pretty woman then shameful loving is a pretty thing and of all things the most divinely human is this love purifies lifes fountain spring and he who has not quaffed that fount is no man id rather be a lover than a king and then preach as we will or may well findthat cupid dear young god is sometimes blind before the world i hold that none of these the shushan slave the oreb shepherdess nor moabs gleaner ever had the ease of carriage grace of speech the statelinessof step and pose nor had the art to please and charm with symphonies of form and dress nor had such wondrous eyes such lovely mouth as had this blue eyed daughter lena of the south had priest or prophet ever heard her singing or seen her where the clover was in bloom wading knee deep while larks were upward springing and winds could scarcely breathe for want of room thus seen her from the dappled hillsides bringing the cows home in the sunsets golden gloom our good old bible would have had much moreof love and romance mixed with sacred lore what man is there who would not dare defend a life like this is doing so a sin or who should blush to be known as her friend white wonder of creation fashioned inthe moulds of loveliness kings might contend on martial fields a prize like her to win and yet the cabins hate and mansions scorn she suffered both betwixt them being born when genial spring first hears the mating thrush where waters gossip and the wild flowers throng love rears her altar in the leafy bush and nature chants the sweetest bridal song when love is free with madness in its rush its very strength defends the heart from wrong love when untutored walks a harmless way with feet though bare that never go astray mind knows no death life is the first and last the falling leaf leaves its source living still the flower which withers in the autumn blast dies not but thus escapes the winters chill and will return through changes strange and vast when summoned forth to range oer vale and hill shall mind which thus perceives lifes changes die hath only matter immortality but if a man die shall he live again this baffling question comes from long ago shall ashes only of lifes torch remain the mind cries out and nature answers no ye who have heard the prophesying rain and seen the flowery resurrection glow ye know of better things than eye hath seen ye know sere earth is mother of the green the wild moose shivers in the north lands breath where hurons wave upbraids the fretful shore the marsh fowl far to southward wandereth and calls her tribes to milder climes explore all nature seems to sigh remember death for all the living soon shall be no more but mark how faith sweeps on with tireless wing to find for een the fowl an endless spring let scoffers mock let unbelief deny agnosticism stolidly ignore let worldly wisdom proudly ask us why and still the soul cries out for something more for something better than philosophy still longs for higher joys and looks before and cannot rest will neer contented be till triumph over matter leaves mind free then hail we all the spirits of the just with lena we shall join them all the mindnow risen looks down on lifes unmeaning dust and soars to higher spheres all unconfined to spheres of love and duty hope and trust and leaves the sordid and corrupt behind the virgin is the sign of vanquished night her child is born born of the soul the light farewell in grandeur sinks the closing day and on our vision slowly fades the light and bygone scenes like shadows fall away to settle in the blank of coming night the octoroon has passed but not for aye to those who have the gift of inner sight the spirit of all nature prophesiesa home for love and beauty in the skies thick throng the snow flakes the evening is dreary glad rings the music in yonder gay hall on her who listens here friendless and weary heavier chill than the winters doth fall at yon clear window light opened before me glances the face i have worshipped so well theres the fine gentleman grand in his glory there the fair smile by whose sweetness i fell this is akin to him shunned and forsaken that at my bosom sobs low without bread had not such pleading my marble heart shaken i had been quiet long since with the dead oh could i enter there ghastly and squalid stand in mens eyes with my spirit oerborne show them where roses bloomed crushed now and pallid what he found innocent leaving forlorn how the fair ladies would fail from their dances trembling aghast at my horrible tale how would he shrink from my words and my glances how would they shrink from him swooning and pale this is the hair that was soft to enchain him snakelike it snarls on my beautiless brow these are the hands that were fond to detain him with a sense magic then powerless now no could i come like a ghost to affright him how should that heal my wound silence my pain had i the wrath of gods lightning to smite him that could not bring me my lost peace again neer let him grieve while good fortunes betide him neer count again the poor game lost of old when he comes forth with his young bride beside him here shall they find us both dead in the cold dear if you change ill never choose again sweet if you shrink ill never think of love fair if you fail ill judge all beauty vain wise if too weak more wits ill never prove dear sweet fair wise change shrink nor be not weak and on my faith my faith shall never break earth with her flowers shall sooner heaven adorn heaven her bright stars through earths dim globe shall move fire heat shall lose and frosts of flame be born air made to shine as black as hell shall prove earth heaven fire air the world transformed shall view ere i prove false to faith or strange to you eloquent silence of everyone i ever loved this cloudy friday evening spring but still cold a smattering of new buds whos that swaddled in the uneasy atmosphere in silence no chatter or pleasant surprise the lusty rush of a weekend with the beloved whos that sprouting now out of the cottony silence with silky whips still hanging from their little chops who is it straining to pop out of the hardwood rings of time into the cool air like theres another cool world on the other side of this one worth pushing through to or maybe were already there is that why we shake image tensed i eye the instant anticipation welling and i expect no one in the lit shadowsi watch as the doorbellsheds its inaudiblepollen of sound and i expect no one within four wallsastounded more by space than any desert place i expect no one but come he will he must if i hold onto bloom unseen hell suddenly appearwhen i am least aware coming as if to forgiveall he gives to death coming to assure me of his reward and mine coming as anodynefor my pain for his perhaps his whisper isalready on its way the man slapped her bottom like a man did in a video then he waited as if for shadow to completely cover the sun moments later archeologists found him the idea that they were reenacting something which had been staged in the first place bothered her if she wanted to go on shed need to ignore this limp chronology she assumed he was conscious of the same constraint but she almost always did want to proceed procedure if only either one of them believed in the spontaneity of the original actors and could identify with one be one for this to work she reasoned one of us would have to be gone well look who missed the fleeting moment green giant gloats over dazed children if to transpose is to know we can cover our losses but only if talking formerly food now meant not now so recovery ran rings if to traverse is to envelop i am held and sung to sleep im jotting down these lines having borrowed a pen from a waitress in this roadside restaurant three rusty pines prop up the sky in the windows my soup gets cold which implies ill eat it cold soon i too will leave a tip on the table merge into the beehive of travelers and board one of the ferries where theres always a line to the loo and no one knows where the captain is slightly seasick i keep on writing of the wind rose and lobster traps seagulls if any and there always are check the air and youll see them above straw hats and caps the sun at noon glides like a monstrous star fish through clouds others drink iced tea training binoculars on a tugboat when i finish this letter ill take a gulp from the flask you gave me for the road in days when i was too young to care about those on the pier who waved goodbye i miss them now cousins in linen dresses my mother you boys in light summer shirts life is too long the compass needle dances everything passes by the ferry passes by ragged yellow shores we stood by a pond that winter day and the sun was white as though chidden of god and a few leaves lay on the starving sod they had fallen from an ash and were gray your eyes on me were as eyes that rove over tedious riddles of years ago and some words played between us to and fro on which lost the more by our love the smile on your mouth was the deadest thing alive enough to have strength to die and a grin of bitterness swept thereby like an ominous bird a wing since then keen lessons that love deceives and wrings with wrong have shaped to me your face and the god curst sun and a tree and a pond edged with grayish leaves the hotel bar downstairs was dirty and dark and almost empty except for him whom i didnt know i lost my balance because evil is aroused by absence outside on the island a brick city had grown up and old a person could only nibble on its shadows where was my beloved the cornerstone was familiar but unrecognizable and i didnt understand why infinity was seeping into my hair somebody said hes out of his bottle i guess it meant temporarily out of service and empty but then there was arsene beside the last remaining cabin wandering with his eyes on the camera dynamite in his pocket and a piece of thread to trap a rabbit evil is a growing thing it has its own gravity and never answers to its name it is a hole into chaos it is real arsene held me in his arms he was drunk as usual and his nipple smelled of rum but still i loved him loved him madly as if he was the one it neednt be tinder this juncture of the year a cigarette second guessed from car to brush the woods parchment is given to cracking asunder the first puff of wind yesterday a big sycamore came across first and hawthorne and is there yet the papers say it has to happen if just as dribs and drabs on the asbestos siding but tonight is buckets of stars as hard and dry as dimes a months supper things stacks in the sink tea brews from water stoppered in the bath and any thirst carried forward is quenched thinking you piece by piece an xmas gift hidden and found weeks after the ribbon the box i have reservoirs of want enough to freeze many nights over what is mysterious about loss flush of arm pulled from a wilted sleeve summers urine tang in autumn leaves let john keats light another fag or bront refuse the doctoron her black sateen settee for whatever part of you may be taken away you said is the scar i will visit firstwith my mouth each time as gold visits the thieved till sun the obliterated sill saying praise you for leavingme this you this living still slight unpremeditated words are borne by every common wind into the air carelessly utterd die as soon as born and in one instant give both hope and fear breathing all contraries with the same wind according to the caprice of the mind but billetdoux are constant witnesses substantial records to eternity just evidences who the truth confess on which the lover safely may rely theyre serious thoughts digested and resolvd and last when words are into clouds devolvd it isnt madness but shame for wanting and shame for not having what i want which is a kind of madness drunk a m the stairwell too steep to climb the bed can wait i go to the pool instead strip and step in the smell of smoke and sweat washing from hair and skin the wet kiss his mouth pressed here my neck and there my chest in the end went nowhere cars pass with coupled strangers i wade the brick wall stretches into the sky the sky empty save the constellations whose lives i love yours most of all father of poets whose lyre filled trees and stones with awe the lover torn to shreds and thrown in to the river tonight youre the swan lost among pinholes of light your throat bitten by a black hole that takes and takes and never fills i kick stroke my tired arms to buoy this body it makes ring after perfect ring but each one breaks along the edge you who never were did you look down on the world at last and see that more wont be enough not now not ever want picks the human heart youre the lie i wont believe forever as day did darken on the dewless grass there still wi nwone a come by me to stay a while at hwome by me within the house all dumb by me i zot me sad as the eventide did pass an there a winblast shook the rattl n door an seemed as win did mwoan without as if my je ne alwone without a stann n on the stwone without wer there a come wi happiness oonce mwore i went to door an out vrom trees above my head upon the blast by

grow vor her a vall n down below vor her o then how happy i should zee you kern but no too soon i voun my charm a broke noo comely soul in white like her noo soul a stepp n light like her an nwone o comely height like her went by but all my grief age n awoke this bald year frozen now in february this cold day winging over the ugly imperfect horizon line so often a teeth line of ten buildings a red flag flapping in the wind an orange curtain is noon it all hurts her eyes this curtain is so bright here is what is noticeably true sight the face that looks back from the side of the butter knife a torn bread awkwardness the mind makes its daily pilgrimage through riff raff moments then back into the caprice case to dream in a circle a pony goes round the circles association theres a center to almost everything but never any certainty nothing is more malleable than a moment we were only yesterday breathing in a sea some summer sun asked us over and over we went the sand was hot we were only yesterday tender hearted waiting to be something a spring and then someone says sit down we have a heart for you to forget a mind to suffer with so experience so the circus tent you over there you be the girl in red sequins on the front of a card selling love you over there you in black satin you be the maidens mister death the mask that burns like a violin the mask that sings only dead languages that loves the destruction of being put on the mask that sighs like a woman even though a woman wears it the mask beaded with freshwater pearls with seeds the plumed mask the mask with a sutured mouth a moonface with a healed gash that means harvest a glower that hides wanting a grotesque pucker heres a beaked mask a braided mask heres a mask without eyes a mask that looks like a mask but isnt please dont try to unribbon it the mask that snows coins the mask full of wasps lace mask to net escaping thoughts pass me the rouged mask the one made of sheet music or the jackal mask the hide bound mask that renders lovers identical with night when my devotions could not pierce thy silent ears then was my heart broken as was my verse my breast was full of fears and disorder my bent thoughts like a brittle bow did fly asunder each took his way some would to pleasures go some to the wars and thunder of alarms as good go anywhere they say as to benumb both knees and heart in crying night and day come come my god o come but no hearing o that thou shouldst give dust a tongue to cry to thee and then not hear it crying all day long my heart was in my knee but no hearing therefore my soul lay out of sight untuned unstrung my feeble spirit unable to look right like a nipped blossom hung discontented o cheer and tune my heartless breast defer no time that so thy favors granting my request they and my mind may chime and mend my rhyme inside the northern generaltheyre trying to burn awaya small piece of your heart i want to know which bit how muchand what it holds my questions livebetween what doctors call the heartand what we mean by it wide as the gap between brain and mind and in our lineage of bypassed heartswe should be gratefulfor the literal i know my heartis your heart good for running not much elseand later as you sit up in your borrowed bedi get the whole thing wrong call it oblation offeringor sacri ce as if youd given something up as if their tiny re was ritualand we could warm by it im a frogman naked by the water under a lean of canvas shed sewn with a thick paraffin thread she gestured when we pulled him from the river his left leg was meal crayfish in the hair the river bottom left his shoulder layered and crocheted my sisters pearl knitting needles clicking in my head i told the sheriff i wouldnt do it again i knew him once his chevy threw a rod i made it with him on the hood of the old truck it was out at the dump beyond yuma it felt like i had bread crumbs all over my mouth wacky with the sun i sure did it with him enough that afternoon i didnt know it was him whod drowned they said it was his cousin he had a three cornered scar at the small of his back and a deposit of calcium on the tailbone were not much you know he was tangled in yellow tree roots he spun in the currents a fishhook and line running from his thumb a whole new ball of wax i thought i wanted to be an astronaut but failed the mathematics twice in one summer so i raise nubian goats my favorite has a purple manure that comes out like steaming packets of tobacco mulch he sprays the shack with his seed it hasnt needed paint in three years i just took my shorts off when you two came down the hill its that rubber suit i wear when i dive into the chute and cave sometimes i just feel like old air in a patched tire then i get my seagrams and come out here you two look married not that i care you wouldnt believe what i was just thinking your husbands the only living man left in this country who knows that i bleach my hair gently let us steep our love in the silence deep as thus branches arching high above twine their shadows over us let us blend our souls as one hearts and senses ecstasies evergreen in unison with the pines vague lethargies dim your eyes and heart at rest freed from all futile endeavor arms crossed on your slumbering breast banish vain desire forever let us yield then you and i to the waftings calm and sweet as their breeze blown lullaby sways the gold grass at your feet and when night begins to fall from the black oaks darkening in the nightingales soft call our despair will solemn sing somewhere zeno was smiling the foul goblins of paradox were wearing their fairest clothes that night my dinner with a chainsaw the evening could have been called and when one too many led to wise judgements too few im trying to break up with you he shouted as stockings and scruples flew and what was over wasnt the brutal doings were sweeter than a caress the thrill of it happening and the horror of it being an awful mistake collided like sweaty bodies in the dark disheveled room so this is moving on she reflected after he left but what was motion no straight bright line but a wind every bit as stormy as the people it carried away from safety through towns that froze and burned helping them forward but not letting them forget for a second their ceaseless looking for what is lost their sad resemblance to the quick and stubborn arrows that never arrive but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again now whilst thy may hath filed thy lap with flowers now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain now use the summer smiles ere winter lowers and whilst thou spreadst unto the rising sun the fairest flower that ever saw the light now joy thy time before thy sweet be done and delia think thy morning must have night and that thy brightness sets at length to west when thou wilt close up that which now thou shewst and think the same becomes they fading best which then shall most inveil and shadow most men do not weigh the stalk for what it was when once they find her flower her glory pass not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgement that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes dont forget this men who live in this time remember the price of each bottle of vodka sunlight on the canal outside the train station with the neighbors ladder my brother tony mosquito and i climb the poplar in the public garden with one and a half bottles of vodka and we drink there all night sunlight on a young girls face asleep on the church steps tony recites poems forgets i cannot hear i watch the sunlight in the rearview mirror of trolleys as they pass dont forget this there sat in the poplar two brothers the barber and podiatrist in love with the same woman they drank there and recited each poem they knew not a soul noticed notasoul ill fly off to a fjord in norway post oh the pain above my doorwayif you insist on going your way for this is not a duck that is what cowards say and realistswho run away shun the appeal itsrare white fur holds although they feel its a rabbit full of pluck lets multiply lets twitch our noses lets walk among the nights dark roses though where the oldest story goes is a place where tongues might cluck ive had my share of quacks and hisses whereof mouth cannot speak it kisses hop to it man and realize this is a lovely bit of luck there was ance a may and she loed na men she biggit her bonnie bowr doun i yon glen but now she cries dool and a well a day come doun the green gait and come here away when bonnie young johnnie cam owre the sea he said he saw naething sae lovely as me he hecht me baith rings and monie braw things and werena my heart licht i wad dee he had a wee tittie that loed na me because i was twice as bonnie as she she raised sic a pother twixt him and his mother that werena my heart licht i wad dee the day it was set and the bridal to be the wife took a dwam and lay doun to dee she maned and she graned out o dolour and pain till he vowed that he neer wad see me again his kin was for ane o a higher degree said what had he do wi the likes o me albeit

linkin it on the lily white lea and wow gin i were but young for thee how vainly men themselves amaze to win the palm the oak or bays and their uncessant labours see crownd from some single herb or tree whose short and narrow verged shade does prudently their toils upbraid while all flowrs and all trees do close to weave the garlands of repose fair quiet have i found thee here and innocence thy sister dear mistaken long i sought you then in busy companies of men your sacred plants if here below only among the plants will grow society is all but rude to this delicious solitude no white nor red was ever seen so amrous as this lovely green fond lovers cruel as their flame cut in these trees their mistress name little alas they know or heed how far these beauties hers exceed fair trees whereseer your barks i wound no name shall but your own be found when we have run our passions heat love hither makes his best retreat the gods that mortal beauty chase still in a tree did end their race apollo hunted daphne so only that she might laurel grow and pan did after syrinx speed not as a nymph but for a reed what wondrous life in this i lead ripe apples drop about my head the luscious clusters of the vine upon my mouth do crush their wine the nectarine and curious peach into my hands themselves do reach stumbling on melons as i pass ensnard with flowrs i fall on grass meanwhile the mind from pleasure less withdraws into its happiness the mind that ocean where each kind does straight its own resemblance find yet it creates transcending these far other worlds and other seas annihilating all thats made to a green thought in a green shade here at the fountains sliding foot or at some fruit trees mossy root casting the bodys vest aside my soul into the boughs does glide there like a bird it sits and sings then whets and combs its silver wings and till prepard for longer flight waves in its plumes the various light such was that happy garden state while man there walkd without a mate after a place so pure and sweet what other help could yet be meet but twas beyond a mortals share to wander solitary there two paradises twere in one to live in paradise alone how well the skillful gardner drew of flowrs and herbs this dial new where from above the milder sun does through a fragrant zodiac run and as it works th industrious bee computes its time as well as we how could such sweet and wholesome hours be reckond but with herbs and flowrs our answering machine still played your message and on the day you died dad asked me to replace it i was chosen to save us the shame of dead you answering calls hello i have just shot myself to leave a message for me call hell the clear cassette lay inside the white machine like a tiny patient being monitored or a miniature glass briefcase protecting the scroll of lost voices everything barely mattered and then no longer did i pressed record and laid my voice over yours muting it forever and even now im sorry we are not here i began she stands beside me stands away the vague indifference of her dreams dreaming to go on and go on there like animals fleeing the rise of the earth but standing intangible my lust a worked anger a sweating close covering for the crudely salty soul then back off and where you go box of words and pictures steel balloons tied to our mouths the room fills up and the house street tilts city slides and buildings slide into the river what is there left to destroy that is not close or closer leaning away in the angle of language pumping and pumping all our eyes criss cross

then ill marry sally o then well wed and then well bed but not in our alley for an hour i forgot my fat self my neurotic innards my addiction to alignment for an hour i forgot my fear of rain for an hour i was a salamandershimmying through the kelp in search of shore and under his fingers the notes slid loosefrom my belly in a long jellyrope of eggsthat took root in the mud and whatwould hatch i did not know a lie a waltz an apostle of glass for an hour i stood on two legs and ran for an hour i panted and galloped for an hour i was a maple tree and under the summer of his fingers the notes seeded and winged away in the clutch of small elegant helicopters but you had the sense that he was always competing with your father for your affection not only my father he didnt understand my need to develop ties in these new worlds he tried to legislate over my feelings he was subject to extraordinarily inappropriate fits of jealousy how are you the judge of that many small incidents such as the boys name was warren he was an orphan as we pulled into the weed lot of the camp in the uncertain march air and patented silence i could see him peeking down at us from a second story dormer window like someone who had been dreaming of escape from the run down resort torn up turf dirt basketball court net hanging for its life by one thin strand of rope horseshoes shuffle board musty mildewed cabins with wet bedding the stars pressing too hard against our faces in the catastrophic silence of the nights id never been left so happily alone alone that is in warrens wonderful company his talk mimicked the cadence of the stones he kicked warren showed me the mica glow in the arrowheads and quartz tipped spears hed unearthed warrens cigar box overflowed with other peoples souvenirs miniature monuments key chains lighters and initialed items like cuff links and bracelets he scoured the corners of the rooms of the departed while his mother slip of the tongue there vacuumed people always leave something behind he said i knew what he meant taking their clothes on and off so many times something had to go i wanted an initial bracelet even with someone elses initials the kids at summer camp in the poconos all had initialed bracelets except for me but who among them had been west of the mississippi warren wanted a home i didnt know what i wanted i asked to bring warren home and give him a home thats ridiculous he has a home here besides you only just met my mother lamented his stick thin soot blackened frame the smell he gave off and his yellow teeth his urchin eating with his hands his short and choppy hair his blousy shirt and baggy fatigues that gave him a bulk a volume he didnt otherwise possess what about his fits of giddy delight as the days passed i forgot myself i became more and more like warren i would brook no insults about my brother it would no longer be me but me and warren id share my meals with warren and my desk at school warren could stay and i would just slip away next to warren i felt like i was on a clipper ship lifted out of the water by the powerful wind breath of my two distant coastal families my warring mother and blood father her lovely companionable family in los angeles and manhattan his friendly compliant relations in manhattan and bensonhurst i dreamt both families were jammed on the deck of the ship waving gesticulating shouting and that i clung to a rafts rope as a great wave flung me back and back but the truth was i wasnt sure i wanted to be near i wanted to fly apart in the nowhere when our two door chrysler windsor edged off the gravel onto the highway i thrust my head right where the plush fabric of the front seat parted like the red sea and said to my new dad you know what i love warren more than i love you you dont know what youre saying he snapped hes just a little putz and i can get rid of him with a snap of my fingers presto see now where is he the seat beside me was empty i was empty and my heart pounded in wild longing for its fullness lost i should have kept my mouth shut but i thought my heart would burst with that secret locked in it why doesnt he understand it wasnt that i loved him less than i had but that i loved warren more he had the same reaction several years later in chicago when i announced my love for carol a round faced soft spoken blond girl id brought home to play with my electric trains and drink hot chocolate one brutal winter afternoon i loved her and i kissed her in the elevator on the way up i wanted him to say im so happy for you lets put on some s and dance he said you dont know what love is and for the first time slapped me in the face i wrote my blood father of my love and he wrote back he was glad i was making friends out there why didnt these men understand i know what words mean by love i meant love however transitory one word two fathers two red stone faces unblinking dismayed where the quiet coloured end of evening smiles miles and miles on the solitary pastures where our sheep half asleep tinkle homeward thro the twilight stray or stop as they crop was the site once of a city great and gay so they say of our countrys very capital its prince ages since held his court in gathered councils wielding far peace or war now the country does not even boast a tree as you see to distinguish slopes of verdure certain rills from the hills intersect and give a name to else they run into one where the domed and daring palace shot its spires up like fires oer the hundred gated circuit of a wall bounding all made of marble men might march on nor be prest twelve abreast and such plenty and perfection see of grass never was such a carpet as this summer time oer spreads and embeds every vestige of the city guessed alone stock or stone where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe long ago lust of glory pricked their hearts up dread of shame struck them tame and that glory and that shame alike the gold bought and sold now the single little turret that remains on the plains by the caper overrooted by the gourd overscored while the patching houseleeks head of blossom winks through the chinks marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time sprang sublime and a burning ring all round the chariots traced as they raced and the monarch and his minions and his dames viewed the games and i know while thus the quiet coloured eve smiles to leave to their folding all our many tinkling fleece in such peace and the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey melt away that a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair waits me there in the turret whence the charioteers caught soul for the goal when the king looked where she looks now breathless dumb till i come but he looked upon the city every side far and wide all the mountains topped with temples all the glades colonnades all the causeys bridges aqueducts and then all the men when i do come she will speak not she will stand either hand on my shoulder give her eyes the first embrace of my face ere we rush ere we extinguish sight and speech each on each in one year they sent a million fighters forth south and north and they built their gods a brazen pillar high as the sky yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force gold of course o heart oh blood that freezes blood that burns earths returns for whole centuries of folly noise and sin shut them in with their triumphs and their glories and the rest love is best i am a slave to the nudity of women i do not know with what resolve i could stand against it a naked woman asking of me anything an unclothed woman is sometimes other things i see her in a dish of green pears anselmo do you know what i mean if i say without clothes her breasts are the two lions in front of the new york public library do you know that postcard of mine in those lions there is something for which i have in exchange only sounds only my fingers i see her everywhere she is the lions and the pears those letters of the alphabet as children we called dirty the w the y the small o she is absolutely the wet clothing on the line or you know to be more intimate may i the nub the nose of the pear do you know what i mean those parts of the woman i will call two spanish dancer hats or rounder sometimes doughboy helmets from the war sometimes they are flat in the late afternoon asleep like drawings like a single rock thrown into the lake these parts of a woman an imperfect circling gyre of lines moving out beyond the water they reach me at the shore anselmo without fail they are stronger and they have always been faster than i am its like watching the lassoing man the man with the perfectly circling rope pedro armendariz in the mexican movies or will rogers wherever one is from whoever this man is and he is always there everybody knows one he always makes his big lasso twirling his rope around himself and a woman from the audience only i am the woman do you understand anselmo caught in the circling rope i am the woman and me thinking of a woman without clothes is that man and that rope and we are riding on separate horses like all children mz n lived in archaic mythic zones and all the neighbors and kin played their parts to a t although they never were able to tell her the whole story the child mz n sat on her bed and wondered that tree outside her window shifted when her eye shifted what to make of that mz n and her siblings had a dog for some time they went on vacation when they came back no dog they asked the parents the dog who replied what dog and some people wonder why others distrust the obvious one year mz n began her great project of investigative touch like everything it came about through reading and happenstance mz n had a friend who said i do it and then i worry what if my roommate hears what if mz n wondered went home and discovered a new octave mz n sometimes thinks what n stands for nothing one day she said nihilism in school the teacher paused chalk between her fingers like her longed for cigarette whats n hilism another student said i thought it was neehilism this was another example of mz n bringing up topics that went nowhere the blackest black is not so black it cannot take a blacker black so mz n thinks the void would speak if void could speak or of color think mz n is writing what she hopes will be a masterpiece mispronunciation the definitiveautobiography she only includes the bloopers she remembers she is very strict like that whats v gi na hard g she called to her parents age five when theyd plopped her on the sofa with a picture book to help her learn where babies some years later she told a story at dinner about being very angry with a persecuting teacher i spoke she sd with great ve h mence her father laughed a somewhat unkind laugh and asked her to repeat it she did once again he laughed mz n vehemently objects to the making fun of children who struggle every day to get their words and bodies aligned one day after sex in a century of bad sex the other one asked mz ndid i leave youon the edge never having had an orgasm as far as she knew she sd quite definitivelyno how would she know such an edgeare you sure the other persisted mz n thought again she could say quite definitivelyoh yes here i am on the edgewhere you left methe edgeof a certainabyss but this she knew was the answer to a question no one was asking mz n embarks one day upon a sonnet attracted by the knowledge that its dead extinct like dinosaur dodo or bonnet long replaced by baseball caps on heads that centuries ago were piled with curls birds powder wires and such machinery twould blow the minds of tattooed boys and girls who cruise the streets of this new century mz n concedes shes antiquarian old hat old news hoarder of ancient dirt to quote the mouldy scot john pinkerton but from her dead end path she wont divert the airplane made the train a living fossil relict herself she listens for its whistle wordsworth never took a plane but mz n takes a plane with wordsworth on her mind and other matters love fear a wish to die wordsworth had a very sturdy mind and legs that took him far into the mountains scottish glens german towns and yes across the alps mz n has never seen the alps nor snowdon nor a mountain anywhere beyond the ancient adirondacks wordsworth too she thinks would like their worndown humps their pathless woods the rowboats by the shores of placid lakes ready for exploring young wordsworth stole a rowboat rowed out on a lake one night and found himself appalled the mountain strode sublime after him and he trembled and his mind as burke had said it would before sublimity near failed there are passages in life in wordsworth he called spots of time and mz n has some spots she sometimes recollects but now shes happy incredulous in love and in strange anguish wants to recollect nothing if it were nowto dietwere now to be most happy she murmurs with the engine nearly exploding with the fragility and perverse strength of all that lives and moves and has its being in the air on the ground in the sea having reached a floating state of grace surprised by joy she wants to die life can only get worse the mountain receding below them as they climb come and let us live my deare let us love and never feare what the sowrest fathers say brightest sol that dies to day lives againe as blithe to morrow but if we darke sons of sorrow set o then how long a night shuts the eyes of our short light then let amorous kisses dwell on our lips begin and tell a thousand and a hundred score an hundred and a thousand more till another thousand smother that and that wipe of another thus at last when we have numbred many a thousand many a hundred weel confound the reckoning quite and lose our selves in wild delight while our joyes so multiply as shall mocke the envious eye today there has been so much talk of things exploding into other things so much that we all become curious that we all run outside into the hot streets and hug romance is a grotto of eager stones anticipating light or a girl whose teeth you can always see with more sparkle and pop is the only way to live your confetti tongue explodes into acid jazz small typewriters that other people keep in their eyes click away at all our farewell parties it is hard to pack for the rest of your life someone is always eating cold cucumber noodles someone will drop by later to help dismantle some furniture a lot can go wrong if you sleep or think but the trees go on waving their broken little hands to all those happy blessings which ye have with plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown this one disparagement they to you gave that ye your love lent to so meane a one yee whose high worths surpassing paragon could not on earth

her she spreads the bath cloth underneath the window and the sunbeams catch her glistening white on the shoulders while down her sides the mellow golden shadow glows as she stoops to the sponge and her swung breasts sway like full blown yellow gloire de dijon roses she drips herself with water and her shoulders glisten as silver they crumple up like wet and falling roses and i listen for the sluicing of their rain dishevelled petals in the window full of sunlight concentrates her golden shadow fold on fold until it glows as mellow as the glory roses the feverish room and that white bed the tumbled skirts upon a chair the novel flung half open where hat hair pins puffs and paints are spread the mirror that has sucked your face into its secret deep of deeps and there mysteriously keeps forgotten memories of grace and you half dressed and half awake your slant eyes strangely watching me and i who watch you drowsily with eyes that having slept not ache this need one dread nay dare one hope will rise a ghost of memory if ever again my handkerchief is scented with white heliotrope billie holidays burned voice had as many shadows as lights a mournful candelabra against a sleek piano the gardenia her signature under that ruined face now youre cooking drummer to bass magic spoon magic needle take all day if you have to with your mirror and your bracelet of song fact is the invention of women under siege has been to sharpen love in the service of myth if you cant be free be a mystery the stars the nights midweek are secrets kept no soul on site no signal bars and zilch for company except a zillion bright disarming stars ill flit through ambers quicker higher ill break each hamlets stop or yield ill fix some noodles start a fire and climb up to the topmost field the stars at first are sparse unclear they surface in that drag between the darkened grass and stratosphere of powder blue and bottle green they blossom thick and fast in droves they pulse in clusters magnify the smoke thats my potbelly stoves frays outwards through each needle eye ill head below ill char till dawn some apple logs down to their core by pewter light when stars have gone ill do a bit a little more the rain you live inside its sound effects whole weeks on end its pin machine its cardboard drum its soft boiled eggs its silent running submarine its like the god of liquid rub ber stirred at dawn to slip downstairs and sip a cigarette to drub his fingertips on solid layers you poured across last summers drought you love it learn to as it slows and even as you come to doubt its dribs and drabs and pigeon toes forget the welcome rain outstayed for days the leaves are parchment sheet and wind hangs chimeless in the shade still rain remains the point of heat the rain is near like everything its best those seconds just before the broadleaf s backwards canvas sling the fly strip flapping through the door the wind the winds this ancient bloke below who chunters we who wheezes us though no one else will come or go you want to ask the wind whos us but hold your tongue till in your head the wind and him have somehow mixed the type of wind that loves a shed and banging on of things not fixed a belt and braces year round wind a kiln dried cobwebbed hardwood wind a greenhouse wind a treebound wind an end of season car boot wind a padlocked shower unit wind an upturned wheelie dumpster wind a channel not quite tuned in wind a hollow flight path thunder wind a dog eared wind a knocked sign wind a spouseless phantom ocean blown autumnal graveyard scots pine wind who speaks in plurals moves alone the grass one night last june in cups in love with pickled gin from bubbly flutes our clothes in coils about the stove we climbed the dark in birthday suits its true the grass was mown that day like hippies chained in meadow flowers we tripped above the cut and lay in blades of petrol suede for hours we listened to the lowing black we giggled kissed we possumed dead we woke as flesh and straggled back like beasts for parlor dressed then read we trafficked grass in bedspreads shoes and never spoke of that again through winters interregnum blues of being spooked by skin of when the only care we had was grass the only stir for miles around our freezing bones our clinking glass our dying to be rumbled found love what ailed thee to leave life that was made lovely we thought with love what sweet visions of sleep lured thee away down from the light above what strange faces of dreams voices that called hands that were raised to wave lured or led thee alas out of the sun down to the sunless grave ah thy luminous eyes once was their light fed with the fire of day now their shadowy lids cover them close hush them and hide away ah thy snow coloured hands once were they chains mighty to bind me fast now no blood in them burns mindless of love senseless of passion past ah thy beautiful hair so was it once braided for me for me now for death is it crowned only for death lover and lord of thee sweet the kisses of death set on thy lips colder are they than mine colder surely than past kisses that love poured for thy lips as wine lovst thou death is his face fairer than loves brighter to look upon seest thou light in his eyes light by which loves pales and is overshone lo the roses of death grey as the dust chiller of leaf than snow why let fall from thy hand loves that were thine roses that loved thee so large red lilies of love sceptral and tall lovely for eyes to see thornless blossom of love full of the sun fruits that were reared for thee now deaths poppies alone circle thy hair girdle thy breasts as white bloodless blossoms of death leaves that have sprung never against the light nay then sleep if thou wilt love is content what should he do to weep sweet was love to thee once now in thine eyes sweeter than love is sleep this song is not a language not a thing to be remembered the field holler tradition of teeth and knees cursing wind a concert hall of bloody hands spilling the earth strangling dirt sledgehammer curses of men busted open on parchman farm you could hear it coming up through the trees the hammering pulpit of crooning men and sweat the tender meat of palms pulped like plums them men gulped down the dawn dew air let it catch in their throats broke the sunrise up and sang hymns like hexes be my woman gal ill beeee your maaaaaaan and the killing fields of mississippi fizzled down to juke joints and the hothouse music of illegal clubs with thick women they loved outright and played cards with and gave bourbon to when their hands didnt hold sorrow like pickaxes and the railroad was just a railroad a way to ride north if you could get your money right redbone gals with rosewater sweat when they lifted their knees sunflower county was a heaven they believed in stick to the promise gal that you maaaaaade meeeeee steady now they turned back the clock on their hard hard hands let the memory of fresh linen and ladies slips like gossamer wings a parade of plump thighs the juju thrust of furious bones spread like grease across starched white sheets midwife them out of ol parchman farm and back to the cockfights and gambling back when they had ambition back when they had a sweet woman to hold her fat wrists soft as butter limp as rain when she walk she reel and rock beeeeeehind aint that enough to make a convict smiiiiiiiiile mississippis where the cock crowed a hoodwink if ever there was one but see how a man can make a steeple outta his hands see how he can break away from his hurt and be god if he wants to how he can keep his mind wrapped in yesterday drown out memory like rain drumming down like hornetsyeahhhhhh them parchman men ants in single file draft dodgers digging trenches pounding concrete laying tracks pretending its christmas so they can keep their hands away from the colic of axe handles the sputtering earth snarling under their feet warden says every man gotta pay his way on parchman farm same as the outside yessuh they remember what it was like to be a man to know that didnt mean put a gun in your hand or go lookin for somebody to take down naw they sang til the hurt was just an experiment in forgetfulness and they were back in clean clothes makin plans and tryin to get a little money to buy tobacco and a pint with a little left over to get somethin sweet for the women who were wet underneath them crooning a tumorless midnight the moans of wild women are specific a whisper of hell danced pink by the rosewater sweat and mewling questions they ask when their clothes are off when you gon take me to the movies we goin saturday baby when you gon get you a steady job workin on it everyday baby why you love me anyway man aint a man alive who could help it the dance you know the dance of being a free man that never shows its fullness to you til its stripped down and gobbled up by railroad tracks and guards in high towers with rifles watching your back bend to question mark under a sun that wont mind its business when the only part of your living life left is in the things you remember about a woman who hung pantyhose off her porch to dry and made you peach cobbler in the middle of the night if you asked nice and danced with you to songs written on the back of a watermelon truck by folk who knew something about longing and those are the songs you give her now while you bust the earth open cuz your heart is a burial plot so stony cant ask nothin of a grave everybody knows that so you dig and pound and snatch and haul and scrape and lift and tote and hammer lay it down man pick it up again man youre knuckles and dreams deferred in a place where every stone every goddamn stone is important i go free lawd i goooooooo free thou god whose high eternal love is the only blue sky of our life clear all the heaven that bends above the life road of this man and wife may these two lives be but one note in the worlds strange sounding harmony whose sacred music eer shall float through every discord up to thee as when from separate stars two beams unite to form one tender ray as when two sweet but shadowy dreams explain each other in the day so may these two dear hearts one light emit and each interpret each let an angel come and dwell tonight in this dear double heart and teach let us go hence my songs she will not hear let us go hence together without fear keep silence now for singing time is over and over all old things and all things dear she loves not you nor me as all we love her yea though we sang as angels in her ear she would not hear let us rise up and part she will not know let us go seaward as the great winds go full of blown sand and foam what help is here there is no help for all these things are so and all the world is bitter as a tear and how these things are though ye strove to show she would not know let us go home and hence she will not weep we gave love many dreams and days to keep flowers without scent and fruits that would not grow saying if thou wilt thrust in thy sickle and reap all is reaped now no grass is left to mow and we that sowed though all we fell on sleep she would not weep let us go hence and rest she will not love she shall not hear us if we sing hereof nor see loves ways how sore they are and steep come hence let be lie still it is enough love is a barren sea bitter and deep and though she saw all heaven in flower above she would not love let us give up go down she will not care though all the stars made gold of all the air and the sea moving saw before it move one moon flower making all the foam flowers fair though all those waves went over us and drove deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair she would not care let us go hence go hence she will not see sing all once more together surely she she too remembering days and words that were will turn a little toward us sighing but we we are hence we are gone as though we had not been there nay and though all men seeing had pity on me she would not see strephon kissed me in the spring robin in the fall but colin only looked at me and never kissed at all strephons kiss was lost in jest robins lost in play but the kiss in colins eyes haunts me night and day overture more loudly to inveigh against your absence raising the volume by at least a third humbly i say ive written this immense astonishing sonata word by word with leitmotivs youll wish youd never heard and a demented shattering cadenza im pained to say that scholarship insists cadenzas are conclusion to concertos not sonatas true sonatas close with what pedantic musicologists waving their ph d s beneath my nose persist in calling recapitulation my double ending is a variation i couldnt choose between them once i chose to write two endings so because i wrote a recapitulation and cadenza my piece concludes two times and then it ends again because ive added on a coda to brush up on sonata structure first the exposition sounds two melodies deeply dissimilar in different keys major and minor part two is a burst of brainstorms scholars call development in which the two themes of the exposition are changed and rearranged past recognition distorted fragmented dissolved and blent into chromatic superimposition till imperceptibly two themes unite and then if everything is going right the piece concludes in recapitulation exposition theme one my life lacks what in lacking you theme two does the material world exist ideally your neurons should resist as yet connecting numbers one and two but note the skill the frightening mastery the lunatic precision it entails to merge these separate themes the way train rails converge as they approach infinity development i dreamed that an encyclopedia opened before my eyes and there i found analogies to sort of stack around my what is life without you here idea like nous detached from anaxagoras like cosmic fire glimmering without a heraclitus there to find it out like square roots waiting for pythagoras like one ness riven from parmenides like nothing without gorgias to detect it like paradox sans zeno to perfect it like plural worlds lacking empedocles like platos chairs and tables if you took the furnitures eternal forms away objects abandoned by reality still look the same but look the way things look when i behold my life without you in it a screwy room where chairs and tables lack dimension from the front the side the back like finity without the infinite where tea parties are held without the hatter its like a single point withdrawn from space its like a physicist who cannot trace the ultimate constituents of matter there is no evidence matter exists thus do i introduce theme number two and i cant prove it but i know its true the physical eludes the physicists theyve chased down matter past atomic rings into small shadows and theyve lost it there it seems that they cant find it anywhere they stalk imaginary floating things like amateurish lepidopterists round babbling brooks and mossy fairy knolls their net strings map out squares of empty holes behold them snatching something in their fists their fingers uncurl cautious on the sight of nothing crushed against the sweaty hand but then im prejudiced you understand not everyone on earth believes im right but lest you think im kidding or perverse i went to hear a lecture just last year about some things which i hold very dear the smallest pieces of the universe the lecturer referred to them as quarks he seemed impervious to the mystery surrounding their invisibility i asked when he concluded his remarks but are quarks physical youd think that he were someone nearly martyred and id said our dutys to die peacefully in bed he took his glasses off and blinked at me were i john milton i would now destroy this moment of high drama and deploy a thirty line homeric simile but im not milton nor was meant to be he put his glasses on and said of course now i may be the south end of a horse but logically and analogically and physically and metaphysically and if it gets to that religiously and absolutely scientifically i dont believe that quarks can pass the test of being there and since theyre fundamental why then the worlds a dream and dreams are mental and since in mental matters east or west i need you for this dreams interpretation stop looking at your watch for ive divined with these two themes uncomfortably combined its time now for the recapitulation recapitulation frankly im disinclined to reassert the themes my exposition indicated stuffed shirts there are and hordes of overrated experts who would slay or badly hurt with airy wave of hand my insights no i will not play to them ill not rehash my song though they with hard and cold cash should bribe me or should tell me where to go my complex principles are explicated under development so let them laugh ill not permit this section to be half so convoluted as anticipated cadenza sing heavnly muse and give me lyric flight give me special effects give me defiance to challenge the academy of science on fundamental points and get them right give me the strength to can the latinisms to forge analogies between the thing nature abhors and my apartment sing to vanquish literary criticisms if possible and literary sharks and even if you feel submicroscopic elements exceed me as a topic please try to back me up regarding quarks thereby to advocate my metaphor absence the vehicle physics the tenor so that the universal void coincides with showing i daresay with showing off the consequences of his going off by showing everything in fact but slides coda me heart detests reviles denounces loathes your absence with a passion like a furnace the shirt of love said eliot will burn us and normally id add loves other clothes burn just as badly but because ive bent a rule or two i wont extend this figure good taste prevents this piece from getting bigger please see above for everything i meant how much do you love me a million bushels oh a lot more than that oh a lot more and tomorrow maybe only half a bushel tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel and is this your heart arithmetic

diewithout writing the unwrittenpleasure of water according to lin yutang both po chuyi and su tungpo desperately admired tao yuanming a poet of nature who wrote a single love poem a poem thought by chinese dilettantes to be the one blemish in a white jade can a poet be faulted for calling a womancarelessly perfect in beauty he chose to long for her by envying the candle that glowed upon her beautiful face the shadow that followed in her every move yet the nature poet tao yuanming at home with the sudden turning of seasons now feared the shadow in darkness a discarded fan that once stirred her hair feared the candle at dawn at last believed that for beauty he had lived in vain she is sixty she lives the greatest love of her life she walks arm in arm with her dear one her hair streams in the wind her dear one says you have hair like pearls her children say old fool record no oiled tongue diary note my lantern bruises the low clouds with light the evening we talked almonds in a bowl she ate none i did not bid her remove her dark gloves as sometime before she had done her dress not so clean as before a last brand not rescued to flame no billow but breath and breath too short a line to twine our hands in marriage i left a last time her in widows silk my lantern clothed in morning dawns on this road so late tonight the white birches i believe i believe i could have loved her her white wrists white the birch trees by lantern bared black gloves pulled off at night become the night do you hear that pulse the deer wander between her hands glean fallen seed at hand bed down in fallen needles and grass those green discs afloat in the night are their eyes caught in lantern light can it be so many wake the forest glows with sight see and am seen a pulse at the stump is breath and rest and breath again infinite in store the game of this land note the plumage of the turkey note the thick meat at breast sap syrup pine plank a copse of wood is cord for furnace a copse is cottage too the owl in the hollow tree screeches because i am too close to truth note the almond tree overmuch with fruit the almond pressed is oil sweet the almond bit is a smoky meat that leaves note it the tongue bathed in oil yellow pines no ever no green except where stems brown needles green i walk on the wooden train the falls water you swam in one cold morning what you braved that ice path a horse fence where fences are horses with long hair i braid the tale of the fall of stables four paws touch dirt stirring a flirt of sky a bundle of rare you bundle into stables i open with sandy tongue taste the grain of barkwater i look at myself in a mirror of weather rain trenzas dirt cups us we drink spin like tornillos a swallows nest like an adobe tornado shit mud feathers forming pitchfork claws eggshells gone we rest in the ocean smalls the pink throat the back door is also the front the only smoke hole feathers rise we follow to say no more of art than that it makes by its very distraction a mode of abiding accordingly its variations each type of thread and piecework named double engagement ring log cabin or broken dishes all built on the same geometric figures precise interception of angle and line so too each tale of love is rooted in that first tale the poet descending to the underworld finally granted his shade wholl follow him only to disappear again perhaps one version has them reunite affixed in their solo chromospheres the stars which to the human eye appear to overlap substanceless love immune at last to gravity and time in texas i might as well recount this as a story theres a town with a courthouse built on concrete and twisted iron edified in red granite capitals architrave of red sandstone with point and punch a carver broached the effigy of his muse he rendered her attractive features down to the very blush of course she spurned him of course there was another to whom she turned love should not be written in stone but written in water i paraphrase the latin of catullus the sculptor carried on not just the face of his beloved but the face of her other lover snaggle toothed wart peppered pudgy them both made into ugly caricatures of themselves as wanton as the carver perceived them and as lewd well craze and degenerate and crack the portraits hold though long since the participants have dwindled into dirt beautiful unbeautiful each with an aspect of exactness tread light upon this pedestal dream instead of a time before your love disfigured a time withstanding even crass wind beaten time itself timings everything the vapor rises high in the sky tossing to and fro then freezes suddenly and crystalizes into a perfect flake of miraculous snow for countless miles drifting east above the world whirling about in a swirling free for all appearing aimless just like love but sensing seeking out its destiny falling to where the two young skaters stand hand in hand then flips and dips and whips itself about to ever so gently land a miracle across her unkissed lips as he blocks the wind raging from the south leaning forward to kiss her lovely mouth locate i love you some where in teeth and eyes bite it but take care not to hurt you want so much so little words say everything i love you again then what is emptiness for to fill fill i heard words and words full of holes aching speech is a mouth god love you dana my lover lost in the horde on this friday night men are moving up down from the bath room to the bar remove this desire from the man i love who has opened the savagery of the sea to me see to it that his wants are filled on california street bestow on him lar gesse that allows him peace in his loins leave him not to the moths make him out a lion so that all who see him hero worship his thick chest as i did moving my mouth over his back bringing our hearts to heights i never hike over anymore let blond hair burn on the back of his neck let no ache screw his face up in pain his soul is so hooked not heroin rather fix these hundred men as his lovers lift him with the enormous bale of their desire im preparing myself for an extended period of loneliness that will begin very soon i think ive illegally downloaded two new depressing songs ive placed a copy of good morning midnight under my pillow for easy reference ive printed out the tablature for every morrissey song i know so i can sing them to myself alone in my room just a few things are needed really to make me calm while i figure out a simple clean and effective way to kill myself with minimal stress for the person who has to find and dispose of my body but ill probably never think of a way because ill probably never kill myself ill just lie in my bed suffocating myself with my pillows while listening to the four songs you said were your favorite and maybe burn myself a little with the iron on special occasions and the next time im in a subway station ill stand a little further on the yellow line or maybe the next im at your apartment ill try a little harder and surfaced a flame in the dark elsewhere of one remembered form just one suppose it the flesh of unspecified man a mouth down deeper between my legs his heavy beard in the beginning against these wet thighs our bodies scribbled in signs to draw the grey curtain of steam back by which we found ourselves surrounded sound of water off the tile or on this sheet of paper stammering by which we came to nestle a will from which the colors rose resilient sparks of orange over the waves of trickled hair on chest and forearm light green to trace the conduits formed by vein of biceps and prick the pink ridges of his brown nipples in brackets raised this tongue in blue translucent embers to emanate where a moon of fingers along the dark red notch of earth is a field over which armies raged with catapults of burning stones until all was left there smoldering below the cheap dropped ceiling jumped like a pot lid boiling when our upstairs neighbor chased his girl that winter falling out of summers skimpy tops shed want our phone her plush lips creased not exactly blonde but luteous we thought pleased the right word was there for that shade of slightly slutty mermaid wincing wed hear him punch along the floor on crutch es a giant bat trying to mince a mayfly sex and violence you called them blondie with dagwood on crystal meth id tell our friends over dinners stewed in noise even his truck cowed black smoked glass outsized wheels flaunted like chrome knuckles we shrank from ducked afraid wed find her later knocking at our door some nights we waited through like captured prey to you id turn in bed saying the furtive words against your back i love youd stroke my hair or hip all our years the same flip crack i do too he you saw the way her body looked at me all address calling me down she was so well turned curve and volume her body presented itself clay i could mold it she you were taboo not totem covered her though your wing gave no shelter your pale plumage became shadow your beak caught in the net of her hair he when i entered her her death became my life in her death swoon she fell away from me the more she fell the deeper i pursued her the deeper i went the more lost she became her body became a forest of echoes hills and valleys echoing each other a language i didnt know surrounded alone she the discarded body lies in long grass flies and wasps fumble there on a summer day the lost girl hums kelly sarah joanne changed into parable prodigal hair flung out body agape like a question the scavenger crow knows shes beautiful outgrowing her name in the noon heat come we to the summer to the summer we will come for the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of bloom and the crow is on the oak a building of her nest and love is burning diamonds in my true lovers breast she sits beneath the whitethorn a plaiting of her hair and i will to my true lover with a fond request repair i will look upon her face i will in her beauty rest and lay my aching weariness upon her lovely breast the clock a clay is creeping on the open bloom of may the merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day and the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest in the whitethorn bush where i will lean upon my lovers breast ill lean upon her breast and ill whisper in her ear that i cannot get a wink osleep for thinking of my dear i hunger at my meat and i daily fade away like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day ask not the cause why sullen spring so long delays her flowrs to bear why warbling birds forget to sing and winter storms invert the year chloris is gone and fate provides to make it spring where she resides chloris is gone the cruel fair she cast not back a pitying eye but left her lover in despair to sigh to languish and to die ah how can those fair eyes endure to give the wounds they will not cure great god of love why hast thou made a face that can all hearts command that all religions can invade and change the laws of evry land where thou hadst placd such powr before thou shouldst have made her mercy more when chloris to the temple comes adoring crowds before her fall she can restore the dead from tombs and evry life but mine recall i only am by love designd to be the victim for mankind beloved i have to adore the earth the wind must have heard your voice once it echoes and sings like you the soil must have tasted you once it is laden with your scent the trees honor you in gold and blush when you pass i know why the north country is frozen it has been trying to preserve your memory i know why the desert burns with fever it was wept too long without you on hands and knees the ocean begs up the beach and falls at your feet i have to adore the mirror of the earth you have taught her well how to be beautiful i kissed a womanwhose freckles aroused our neighbors her trembling lipsmeant come to bed her hair falling down in the middleof the conversationmeant come to bed i walked in my hospital of thoughts yes i carried her off to bedon the chair of myhairy arms but parted lipsmeant kiss my parted lips i read those lipswithout understandingsoft lips meantkiss my soft lips such is a silence of a woman who speaks against silence knowing silence is what moves us to speak the answer is entropy how smell works little bits of everything always spinning off from where they were flying off at random into the world which is to say into air there are other ways of solid to gas theyre substance specific like iodine or dry ice how i felt when i saw you straight to a new state without passing through expected ones as though enough of me left at the moment you appeared that i could never be whole without you apply heat i turn straight into ether when you take the lost road you come to the snow and when you find the snow you get down on your hands and knees like a sick dog thats been eating the grasses of graveyards for twenty centuries when you take the lost road you find woman who has no fear of light who can kill two cocks at once light which has no fear of cocks and cocks who cant call in the snow you find lovers whove been listening for the same roosters to sing for twenty centuries roosters that have swallowed stones out of each others tracks but have never met anywhere on the road when you take the lost road you find the bright feathers of morning laid out in proportion to snow and light and when the snow gets lost on the road then the hot wind might blow from the south and there is sadness in bed for twenty centuries and everyone is chewing the grass on the graves again when you get lost you come to the moon in the field the light all lovers soil the sheet no one leaves clean the light cocks are afraid to cross the same moon woman danced under for twenty centuries with blood on her face when you get lost on the road you run into the dead who have broken down stones in their throats for twenty centuries i saw two little crazy boys crying because it was morning and when morning comes it comes in the morning and never at night i saw two security police taking out a mans balls and i saw two little crazy boys crying by the road who wouldnt go away but two has never been a number because its only legal to pass one at a time its only a drum you can carry but you cant beat its the evidence they need to make you disappear next to my own skin her pearls my mistress bids me wear them warm them until evening when ill brush her hair at six i place them round her cool white throat all day i think of her resting in the yellow room contemplating silk or taffeta which gown tonight she fans herself whilst i work willingly my slow heat entering each pearl slack on my neck her rope shes beautiful i dream about her in my attic bed picture her dancing with tall men puzzled by my faint persistent scent beneath her french perfume her milky stones i dust her shoulders with a rabbits foot watch the soft blush seep through her skin like an indolent sigh in her looking glass my red lips part as though i want to speak full moon her carriage brings her home i see her every movement in my head undressing taking off her jewels her slim hand reaching for the case slipping naked into bed the way she always does and i lie here awake knowing the pearls are cooling even now in the room where my mistress sleeps all night i feel their absence and i burn little box talks back with a new set of teeth and pink gums a fake nose and a wax mustache she disguises

the nobles filled the benches and the ladies in their pride and mongst them sat the count de lorge with one for whom he sighed and truly twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show valour and love and a king above and the royal beasts below ramped and roared the lions with horrid laughing jaws they bit they glared gave blows like beams a wind went with their paws with wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother the bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air said francis then faith gentlemen were better here than there de lorges love oerheard the king a beauteous lively dame with smiling lips and sharp bright eyes which always seemed the same she thought the count my lover is brave as brave can be he surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me king ladies lovers all look on the occasion is divine ill drop my glove to prove his love great glory will be mine she dropped her glove to prove his love then looked at him and smiled he bowed and in a moment leaped among the lions wild the leap was quick return was quick he has regained his place then threw the glove but not with love right in the ladys face by god said francis rightly done and he rose from where he sat no love quoth he but vanity sets love a task like that reading in the paper a summary of a five year psychological study that shows those perceived as most beautiful are treated differently i think they could have just asked me remembering a kind of pudgy kid and late puberty the bloody noses and wisecracks because i wore glasses though we all know by now how awful it is for the busty starlet no one takes seriously the loveliest women ive lunched with lamenting the opacity of the body they can never trust a mans interest even when he seems not just out for sex eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass and who would want to live like this and what does beauty do to a man don juan casanova lord byron those fiery eyes and steel jawlines can front a furnace of self loathing all those breathless women rushing to him while hubbys at the office or ball game primed to be consumed by his beauty while he stands next to it watching so maybe the looks were dealt are best its only common sense that happiness depends on some bearable deprivation or defect and who knows what conflicts great beauty could have caused what cruelties one might have suffered from those now friends what unmanageable possibilities smiling at every small turn so if i get up to draw a tumbler of ordinary tap water and think what if this were nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers will all ive missed knock me senseless no of course not it wont remembering you and reviewing our structural love the

or burn is bless ed best o stranger to my bed there is no pity in the flesh xii once again i look out your window and the world looks oddly different maybe the fields have blossomed or perhaps more stars have been born delirious waves caress my feet something new unknown sunsets whisper in my ear as well everywhere i find your odor your shape you are among old growth pines in the fog along the coastal rocks around the most somber of afternoons impossible to wipe away your job from my eyes from my sad mouth you are the universe made flesh in the wake riding north on the bus after hours in cars or in the air or airports or bus stations i felt almost happy for a moment as the tires hissed over the wet highway i was both in the rain and protected from it distracted from grief by the sensual pressure of the instant water beading on the glass the darkening hills but how glad i was to be riding north sunoco on one side mobil on the other his best friend was from mobile i always wanted to go there he died too soon or i left home i cant remember two days ago my stepfathers body was laid to rest comatose sucking air through a respirator i cant say he was resting i saw him underground when i closed my eyes at night and went to bury the clock under mounds of towels and pillows i had not heard it ticking so ferociously while he lived and it would not quiet down and the rain tonight its not like any other and i wish the bus would go faster i saw the rain in the heavy hanging clouds thats a lie immense factories blackening under a charcoal sky and rivers whose names ill never remember i saw a sign reflected in my window milwaukee light whenever the chicago white sox beat the braves it made his day the braves were in milwaukee then with lefty warren spahn and slugger hank aaron the bus company is peter pan and the peter pan coffee shop was our first stop in chicago when we drove in and thats where i was when though i didnt know it then he married my mother in bermuda watching peter pan in new york with my real father and oh those prophetic lines not to grow up never to go to school never then to die only the living are immortal like these rain clouds the fact of death a silence attends it an absence with which were all he was the lightest sleeper id ever known hed open one eye if i merely peeked into his room intimate hes there when i close my eyes but not when i reach out in the dark at his bedside i peeled back his eyelids rubbed his blue feet his bloated hands almost screamed in his ear wake up man ill be lonely without you ill be angry if you dont wake up and in the silence of our nearness to death the grinding hum of the generators working at their limit for too long to pump cool air in the killing heat the glug of him swallowing through the respirator at the bus station in springfield massachusetts the lateness of the bus angers a tough young woman from montana travelling with her toddler son and yet she knows the way i can see it in her green peaked cap her direct taut anger bus late i kill the driver boy knock oversuitcase i kill him too bus boarded the water bubbles on the windows break there is less and less outside to see and he was not even my real father that should put a cap on it its like knowing the name of the lake you pass never seeing it again and yet finding it tough to forget that jagged square of black water just off the highway that lake and not another baudelaire boasted that he laughed at funerals and wept at feasts now in the bus its only early evening i turn around and everyones sleeping mother and son matron and magician half awake i stare at the tree line and the blessing of rain and i would like to lie down on the roadside and drink and drink and roll in the mud mortifying ones presence in the face of natures sanguine gaze green whitewashing the past whatever grooms the body for the afterlife pitches in this life like a tent in a night encampment before the dawn storming of the fortress the yellow day lilies wag their heads at the first touch of wind and i see what others have always seen in flowers a sign marked transients that keeps them awake see now as standing catatonic at the kitchen sink the overhead fluorescent light strip sinks into the pitch dark bottom of a coffee mug seeing is native to us and yet we stupefy our native sight not the eyes sight some mourners hurl dirt stiffly on the coffin because it seems the right thing to do some hold back the flag draped casket honors the first army chaplain in the pacific theater for praying good prayers above the bodies of the dead and of the living prelude to an afterword why should i feel compelled to write a thousand postscripts when i dont work from life but to hear the testimonials of people who knew the rider the little rabbi moves me to tears while i am here to attend my mother who lies in bed with her stomach reaching toward the sky where sam talks calmly to his grandpa in heaven matter of fact celestial discourse and i listen to this baptist preacher and hospice worker as he crouches beside my chair in her hospital room talk about his work with mourning how difficult it is to get people to understand the element of surprise over time how he kissed the little rabbi the first time he met him and the last time he saw him before death took him so swiftly there were no last words and he was enveloped in silence in absence the way death often comes i see him more clearly through this strangers eyes i wouldnt have thought that he could help confirm my sense of what is real but this man who knew him less than two years feels so indebted that i allow myself to think of the riders life in terms of the people he affected the bizarre love he could elicit not standard preacherly fare by any means but some connection by being entirely present for others promiscuously present meanwhile as the nurses haul my mother from wheelchair to bed why do i feel impelled to turn away we think we have the answers and flash to an image of my friend caring for her father bathing him but she didnt come out of his penis did she or is that another wrong turning in my thought the hospice preacher offers a prayer he holds my mothers swollen psoriatic hand the arthritic clumps poling from her fingers and as the dry flaky patches blaze in the unforgiving light i find not a word to object to except two religion and churches i tell him that i left home as soon as i could because i couldnt stand being around the two of them he admits he always felt sick for hours afterward when hed been with them together it wasnt just quarreling i have to add seeking absolution for my absence but hatred cant let my mother milk the bereaved widow role he nods matter of factly and sets me free there was a ship went into the sea over the body of my brother i am just a boy he was not much older than me the goddess is good and cruel wants her share of life like us sparkling dust of birds far away whom we follow the stars the blood red dust of life as my brothers face disappeared beneath us beneath the ship which carried us and the goddess to where we do not know leaving the war of my grandfather the smell of smoke following us our keel my brother knocking down the doors of the sea the tall and the wild waves coming crashing under the keel of my brothers name far from the sound of places we were leaving the roads we followed marching past my uncles crooked mountain forts while his men called out at us with our long hair on our shoulders first by my brothers name who was this girl with him leave her with us she is my brother he said not glancing at me our songs we sang in the warm rain for the goddess blessed be her name her cloak the wild wood pigeons turning her crown the lone plovers crying where now are you brother more then most faire full of the living fire kindled above unto the maker neere no eies but joyes in which al powers conspire that to the world naught else be counted deare thrugh your bright beams doth not the blinded guest shoot out his darts to base affections wound but angels come to lead fraile mindes to rest in chast desires on heavenly beauty bound you frame my thoughts and fashion me within you stop my toung and teach my hart to speake you calme the storme that passion did begin strong thrugh your cause but by your vertue weak dark is the world where your light shined never well is he borne that may behold you ever talking to my friend emily whose drinking patterns and extravagance of personal feeling are a lot like mine im pretty convinced when she explains the things we do while drinking a cocktail to celebrate the new account turns into a party that lasts till a m and a terrific hangover indicate a problem of a sort id not considered ive been worried about how i metabolize the sauce for four years since my second bout of hepatitis when i kissed all the girls at christmas dinner and turned bright yellow christmas night but never about whether i could handle it its been more of a given the stage set for my life as an artistic queer as much of a tradition in these new york circles as incense for catholics or german shepherds for the blind we re enact the rituals and our faces like smoky icons in a certain light seem to learn nothing but understand all it comforts me yet isnt all that pleasant like drinking ripple to remember high school a friend of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades talking to the same types but progressively fewer blonds joe lesueur says hes glad to have been a young man in the fifties with his tab hunter good looks because that was the image men desired now its the puerto rican angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity that springs out of machismo rather than a moral choice his argument is pretty convincing too except lots of the pretty blonds ive known default by dying young leaving the field to the swarthy cameron burke the dancer and waiter at magoos killed on his way home from the pines when a car hit his bike on the sunrise highway henry post dead of aids a man i thought would be around forever surprising me by his mortality the way i was surprised when i heard he was not the grandson of emily post at all just pretending like the friend he wrote about in playgirl blair meehan was faking when he crashed every a list party for a year by pretending to be kay meehans son a masquerade that ended when a hostess told him your mothers here and led him by the hand to the dowager woman behold thy son underneath a darkening conviction that all if not wrong was not right by now henry may have faced the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky stay as outrageously nasty as you were and patrick mack locked into memory as he held court in the anvil by the downstairs pinball machine and writhing as he danced in lita hornicks parlor when the stimulators played her party dead last week of causes i dont know as if the cause and not the effect were the problem my blond friend chuck shaw refers to the bone crusher in the sky and im starting to imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods flickering on at twilight as i used to do in the years when i crashed more parties and acted more outrageously and met more beauties and made more enemies than ever before or ever again i pray its spring and theres another crop of kids with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self esteem from my arrival in new york who plug into the history of prettiness convincing to themselves and the devout we who are about to catch the eye of someone new salute as the cotillion passes led by blonds and followed by the rest of us a formal march to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia that hides the trash sprout magically at our approach i toast it as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent as a blond in love my clothes smell like the smoky bar but the sweetness of the april airs delicious when i step outside and fill my lungs leaning my head back in a first class seat on the shuttle between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds to come and an enormous irish wake in which the corpses change but the party goes on forever once again youve fallen for the lure of his deferral his quick eyes

for like two or three days and still id push my downy face into your neck used to be i hung on your every word sing youd say and i was a bird freedom youd say and i never really knew what that meant but liked the way it rang like a rusty bell used to be but now i can tell you your breath stinks and youre full of shit you have more lies about yourself than bodies beneath your bed rootingfor the underdog team player hook line and sinker love you helped design the brick that built the walls around the castle in the basement of which is a vault inside of which is another vault inside of which you get my point your tongue is made of honey but flicks like a snakes voice like a bird but everyones ears are bleeding from the inside your house shines and shines but from outside you can see its built from bones from out here it looks like a graveyard and the gardens all ash and besides your breath stinks were through suppose i said the word springtime and i wrote the words king salmon on a piece of paper and mailed it to you when you opened it would you remember that afternoon we spent together in the yellow boat when the early whales were feeding and we caught our first fish of the year or would you remember that time off cape flattery when you were a little girl your father smoking telling stories as he ran the boat then the tug and zing of that very first fish spooling off into the gray green world you laughing and brushing back your hair before setting the hook i know i am hard to understand sometimes particularly when you are standing at the post office with only a piece of paper saying king salmon on it but just think of it as a promissary note and that electric tug that thrill pulling your mind into deep water is how i feel about you every single day go to the western gate luke havergal there where the vines cling crimson on the wall and in the twilight wait for what will come the leaves will whisper there of her and some like flying words will strike you as they fall but go and if you listen she will call go to the western gate luke havergal luke havergal no there is not a dawn in eastern skies to rift the fiery night thats in your eyes but there where western glooms are gathering the dark will end the dark if anything god slays himself with every leaf that flies and hell is more than half of paradise no there is not a dawn in eastern skies in eastern skies out of a grave i come to tell you this out of a grave i come to quench the kiss that flames upon your forehead with a glow that blinds you to the way that you must go yes there is yet one way to where she is bitter but one that faith may never miss out of a grave i come to tell you this to tell you this there is the western gate luke havergal there are the crimson leaves upon the wall go for the winds are tearing them away nor think to riddle the dead words they say nor any more to feel them as they fall but go and if you trust her she will call there is the western gate luke havergal luke havergal yesterday i wanted to speak of it that sense above the others to me important because all that i know derives from what it teaches me today what is it that is finally so helpless different despairs of its own statement wants to turn away endlessly to turn away if the moon did not no if you did not i wouldnt either but what would i not do what prevention what thing so quickly stopped that is love yesterday or tomorrow not now can i eat what you give me i have not earned it must i think of everything as earned now love also becomes a reward so remote from me i have only made it with my mind here is tedium despair a painful sense of isolation and whimsical if pompous self regard but that image is only of the minds vague structure vague to me because it is my own love what do i think to say i cannot say it what have you become to ask what have i made you into companion good company crossed legs with skirt or soft body under the bones of the bed nothing says anything but that which it wishes would come true fears what else might happen in some other place some other time not this one a voice in my place an echo of that only in yours let me stumble into not the confession but the obsession i begin with now for you also also some time beyond place or place beyond time no mind left to say anything at all that face gone now into the company of love it all returns ring out your bells let mourning shows be spread for love is dead all love is dead infected with plague of deep disdain worth as nought worth rejected and faith fair scorn doth gain from so ungrateful fancy from such a female franzy from them that use men thus good lord deliver us weep neighbours weep do you not hear it said that love is dead his death bed peacocks folly his winding sheet is shame his will false seeming holy his sole exector blame from so ungrateful fancy from such a female franzy from them that use men thus good lord deliver us let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read for love is dead sir wrong his tomb ordaineth my mistress marble heart which epitaph containeth her eyes were once his dart from so ungrateful fancy from such a female franzy from them that use men thus good lord deliver us alas i lie rage hath this error bred love is not dead love is not dead but sleepeth in her unmatched mind where she his counsel keepeth till due desert she find therefore from so vile fancy to call such wit a franzy who love can temper thus good lord deliver us or the unfortunate story of the unmarried flora carrillo and the man who loved her before he died his famous death from whose single liaison a daughter was born and the advice rather the explanation both of them left for her and the story also of what she became and that she was happy three did not count a fourth was forgiven by the father torres in exchange for reasonable payment two full days of the hail mary bigger than priests the fifth indiscretion was born on a thursday early evening in a november not too cold no rain had fallen and the birds had not yet gone she chose a black dress this flora florita here evoke the names of saints underneath which she carried tonight an old blade but of fine toledo forging long as the member of this man in love with this woman standing at his door her head was filled with the vines of the jungle the noises of a lion the feel of ten birds trying with their beaks to get out all anger that she had hoped he would come to her bedroom and that he had faster than that she took from him his rolled tongue hanging there between his thin legs his two fingers this girls wrist and fist of his its central tendon and skin that moved on itself this small and second body of his which had found its way to her second mouth this part of himself which he had given her then taken back on this same day earlier his ugly afternoon of loving her too much he would scream as she had when she had taken him in first as a leg bone and held him there too long too much until he had become a pinky finger here evoke the holy names which she took now and put in the dowry she would make for her new daughter with it she would write a note nothing else was left to do daughter you will be an only child the story of your birth will smell on you do this take baths filled with rosemary with leaves with pinched orange peels keep secret the fact of yourself be happy enough happy with this much life ask for nothing do not live for a long time he sang to her the oldest song that he was a piccolo flute in the small of her heart or if that were not convincing too much filled with flowers a small noise then a smart a cut which is healing its face feeling good to be scratched the way even wild cats like a piccolo flute in the small of her heart nothing more and nothing more necessary a noise different from all the rest louder and more shrill a good sound of haunting the voice of a muslim caller at dawn a bird a saturday four directions and a need he sang this and did not sing in that manner of speech afforded the heart that he was a man came to her not from any words not like that but from the measure of his breathing from the five ladder depth of his left eye the one that did not move his one eye which while his right eye could move through the everyday could only stay looking at her when she looked at this eye at first the sight of it made a noise in her a start a note somewhere at the top of the piano scales fear almost a grasped breath a glass dropped in the moment was the music of being wanted or of wanting but she could not think it certainly she could only say no the way anyone would after a glass falls no and jesus and as an afterthought that he should go away many years later she read a book and it took her breath how neatly the glasses for champagne thrown by the fine heroes broke against the walls holding fire that this was a celebration that this was the continental the european no she said to this thick railroad tie of a man who sang to her the oldest song the one of being young that he was a piccolo flute in the small of her heart no she said but said it with her mouth not with her heart making no a spoken word like all other words so that he did not hear so that he kept singing until one day it was enough but not for her not now now instead the afternoon which was kind which is what she was earlier had only pretended for himi am her whispered it to him let him be strong in its arms one more time before it took him holding tighter than a grandmother this was not at all what he wanted but what he wanted he could not have no she said and he could not get close enough could not put the ear of his song heart against her chest to know what the word meant no he had written no note for his daughter it had not been necessary she knew now what it would have been what the word no means when it is pronounced when the last half of it lingers o imagined that the o was like thistogether as if it were new nude in the afternoon they must have danced the wild apache without lunch into the hours imagining themselves french striped shirt and berets two carp on a rug in the ocean of the room two june beetles two bees beings with impossible wings pulleys from the roof pulling the two of them up like birthday pi atas two of them then four hands and legs tied more expertly than the best dream of an old salt sailor bread dough wound round and again into afternoon cakes two four then six of them all the parts of the face then twelve of them their two faces together twenty four then and thirty six and words and breaths inside each other their tongues like the wings of hummingbirds in flight like bees his fingers faster than possible that it was like this exactly her fame was as a maker of oval mats many years later mats for placement behind photographs how the old ones were sometimes in colors sometimes to highlight sometimes for support simply always making the best faces but what she loved most what was true for her was her firm putting of the tongues and most heavy parts of several men of the town each on a different night sundays being specially reserved for the troubled boy on a rancho several kilometers out of town putting them slowly into her mouth this best of all and sucking there at them better than if she were drawing out the juice of an orange small hole made in it the way children do squeezing out the everything it was better described this deliverance of her men this taking out from their baby arms what it was that troubled them so much all at once so much like the stories she had heard of the ghost being delivered being let go from the mouth exactly at the point of death she would trade nothing for this for being able to say yes where others had said no to say yes and watch her men die die and then be brought back to be strong at this this was her power this is what made her laugh being her mother and her father both being happy for them all never once making love to a man whenever we wake still joined enraptured at the window each clear nights finish the black pulse of dominoes dropping to land whenever we embrace haunted upwelling i know a reunion is taking place hear me when i say our loves not meant to be an opiate helpmate you are the reachable mirror that dares me to risk the caravan back to the apogee the longed for arms of the beloved dusks of paperwhites dusks of jasmine intimate beyond belief beautiful signor no dread of nakedness beautiful signor my long ship my opulence my garland beautiful signor extinguishing the beggars tin the wind of longing beautiful signor laving the ruined country the heart wedded to war beautiful signor the kiln blaze in my body the turning heaven beautiful signor you cover me with pollen beautiful signor into your sweet mouth this is the taproot against all strictures desecrations ill never renounce never relinquish the first radiance the first moment you took my hand this is the endless wanderlust dervish yours is the april upon april love that kept me spinning even beyond your eventful arms toward the unsurpassed the one vast claiming heart the glimmering the beautiful and revealed signor i thought you had a summer home in barcelona because i had seen pictures of you in front of la sagrada fam lia and knew your father had money so maybe thats why when i first met you i didnt know what to say someone too worldly to have anything to learn from me then there was your halloween party where i managed not to be in any of the photos perhaps it was for the best upstairs on a couch ill never sit on again an image of us has started to yellow me blushing because jamie lee curtiss breasts are on screen and you nervous because all your other guests left us alone nothing happened at least for another year or so sometimes its hard to guess how long film needs to be exposed i wanted to get the colors right the dragonflies again the last time seeing them skim the river close to forgotten their singing their shimmer now remembered becoming so much flame as tongues over the heads of the chosen in the childs picture book of christ i learned by heart descent and weight of after the fact the gift the fork between hope and vanity the river that eatsitself turned mirror broken into light the corpse between the beloveds good word and the beloved who having spoken was ever spokeninto being lies unspeaking and as with any heaviness that lowersthen hovers remains inconceivable so the letter given in stone perfection in fire love all loves failures the winged animaldrops to the earth and is there buried in a hole where it digs in the grit like the blade we left in the riverbed adrift and cry shaped in the memory both that dim and that loud though no accosting why itseems that way everything ghost of itself or everything made of mythic proportion the walkersinking from the face of the waters the dragon ibecome when i talk to myself what a belief is terrifyingand relentless ive never been able to tell the difference the brute and the apparitionin reflection speak at once the rock and the rocks light so that now the insect thrums and it is surelya kind of tenderness an oding in secret turning into while turningfrom the soul the animal raised and devoured in dream imagine the childs wished for surface gives and ripples up to mouththe perfect imprint saying aircraft and there are aircraft amen the walker is surrounded by flight on all sides the walker walks without wings see the recollection is flawless turning wings of jewels the recollection is absolute swallows whole echoes and the dragon feasts and the dragon flies again on seventeen i come from hearty straw my grandpa wore a gallonhat my grandma like a shogun bun and shawl for their honeymoon they went to the movies no oneknows what they saw you arrive with licorice cigarettes the documentary on woody allen dont feign a passion for his startin tv or his clarinets or love and death just skip to the soon yi part i was out last night the very picture of a sneak dark and hunched over breaking and entering again why do i do it and why when i can afford serious residences do i keep to this one room perhaps if i had not lost track of the difference between the real and the ideal it would never have happened i hide here almost entirely now when i go out when i creep into those silent houses i steal newspapers an armload no more than i can carry comfortably sometimes they are already tied up on the side porch or by the kitchen stove nobody misses them they think each other or the maid has carried them out to the street they say there is something intractable out there the law the right to privacy the world in the days when my obsession was only a wound up toy squeaking and jabbering in my chest i could have believed them i sit by the window today there is very little space left now thought i have left corridors wide enough to walk through so i wont lose touch holding my latest on my lap handling them fondling them taking in every column they are becoming more and more precious my delusion grows and spreads lately it seems to me as i read of murders wars bankruptcies jackpot winnings the news if written in that perfect style of someone speaking to the one who knows and loves him long before they miss me i think the room will be perfectly solid when they break in the door and unsurprised hardened to the most bizarre vagaries begin to carry out my treasure deaths what theyll look for underneath it all those fluent muscled imaginative men sweating in their innocent coveralls but i will be out in broad daylight by then answering having accepted utterly the hearts conditions tell them i wish them well always that ive been happy for i have seen love and his face is choice heart of hearts a flesh of pure fire fusing from the center where all motion is one and i have known despair that the face has ceased to stare at me with the rose of the world but lies furled in an artificial paradise it is hell to get into if i knew you were there i would fall upon my knees and plead to god to deliver you in my arms once again but it is senseless to try one can only take means to reduce misery confuse the sensations so that this face what aches in the heart and makes each new start less close to the source of desire fade from the flesh that fires the night with dreams and infinite longing my skiff is made of spicewood my oars are cassia bractmusic flows from bow to starboard early mozart cool side of coltrane and miles and miles of miles cheap californian merlot and my young boyfriend if i could master the nine doors of my bodyand close my heart to the cries of sufferingperhaps i could love you like no otherfloat my mind toward the other side of hate the shanty towns of tijuana sing for youthe slums of little sudan hold evening prayerone dead brown boy is a tragedy ten thousand is a statistic so lets fuck my love until the dogs pass all beautiful boyfriends are transitorythey have no souls theyre shiny brown fleshtomorrow theyll turn into purple festering corpsesfissured gored by a myriad flies down the

poor will be submerged the rich wont be savedpurge the innocent sink the depraved what do i smell but the perfume of transiencecrushed calyxes rotting phloemslets write pretty poems pretty poems pretty poemsmasque stale pogroms with a sweet whiff of oblivion my hair voluminous from sleeping in six different positions redolent with your scent helps me recall that last night was indeed real that its possible for a bedspread to spawn a watershed in the membrane that keeps us shut in our own skins mute without pleasure that i didnt just dream you into being you fit like a fig in the thick of my tongue give my hands their one true purpose find in my shoulder a groove for your head in a clinch youre clenched and im pinched were spooned forked wrenched lynched in a chestnut by a mob of our own making only to be resurrected to stage several revivals that arise from slightest touch to thwart deep sleep with necessities i never knew i knew until meeting you a few days or many distant voluptuous lifetimes ago after the clash of elevator gates and the long sinking she emerges where a slight thing in the mornings crosstown glare she looks up toward the window where he waits then in a fleeting taxi joins the rest of the huge traffic bound forever west on such grand scale do lovers say good bye even this other pair whose high romance had only the duration of a dance and who now taking leave with stricken eye see each in each a whole new life forgone for them above the darkling clubhouse lawn bright perseids flash and crumble while for these who part now on the dock weighed down by grief and baggage yet with something like relief it takes three thousand miles of knitting seas to cancel out their crossing and unmake the amorous rough and tumble of their wake we are denied my love their fine tristesse and bittersweet regrets and cannot share the frequent vistas of their large despair where love and all are swept to nothingness still theres a certain scope in that long love which constant spirits are the keepers of and which though taken to be tame and staid is a wild sostenuto of the heart a passion joined to courtesy and art which has the quality of something made like a good fiddle like the roses scent like a rose window or the firmament whoever you are holding me now in hand without one thing all will be useless i give you fair warning before you attempt me further i am not what you supposed but far different who is he that would become my follower who would sign himself a candidate for my affections the way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive you would have to give up all else i alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting the whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandond therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further let go your hand from my shoulders put me down and depart on your way or else by stealth in some wood for trial or back of a rock in the open air for in any roofd room of a house i emerge not nor in company and in libraries i lie as one dumb a gawk or unborn or dead but just possibly with you on a high hill first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares or possibly with you sailing at sea or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island here to put your lips upon mine i permit you with the comrades long dwelling kiss or the new husbands kiss for i am the new husband and i am the comrade or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip carry me when you go forth over land or sea for thus merely touching you is enough is best and thus touching you would i silently sleep and be carried eternally but these leaves conning you con at peril for these leaves and me you will not understand they will elude you at first and still more afterward i will certainly elude you even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me behold already you see i have escaped from you for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book nor is it by reading it you will acquire it nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few prove victorious nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil perhaps more for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit that which i hinted at therefore release me and depart on your way she goes out to hang the windchime in her nightie and her work boots its six thirty in the morning and shes standing on the plastic ice chest tiptoe to reach the crossbeam of the porch windchime in her left hand hammer in her right the nail gripped tight between her teeth but nothing happens next because shes trying to figure out how to switch with she must have been standing in the kitchen coffee in her hand asleep when she heard it the wind blowing through the sound the windchime wasnt making because it wasnt there no one including me especially anymore believes till death do us part but i can see what i would miss in leaving the way her ankles go into the work boots as she stands upon the ice chest the problem scrunched into her forehead the little kissable mouth with the nail in it when we talk about when to tell the kids we are so together so concentrated i mutter i feel like a killer imthe killer taking my wrist he says holding it he is sitting on the couch the old indigo chintz around him rich as a night sea with jellies i am sitting on the floor i look up at him as if within some chamber of matedness some dust i carry around me tonight to breathe its magellanic field is lesspainful maybe because he is drinkinga wine grown where i was born fog eucalyptus sempervirens and imsharing the glass with him dont catchmy cold he says oh thats right you wantto catch my cold i should not have told him that i tell him i will try to fall out of love with him but i feel i will love himall my life he says he loves meas the mother of our children and new troupesof tears mount to the acrobat platformsof my ducts and do their burning leaps some of them jump straight sideways and for amoment i imagine a flurryof tears like a whirra of knives thrownat a figure to outline it a hearts spurt of rage it glitters in my vision i nodto it it is my hope i throughout the afternoon i watched them there snow fairies falling falling from the sky whirling fantastic in the misty air contending fierce for space supremacy and they flew down a mightier force at night as though in heaven there was revolt and riot and they frail things had taken panic flight down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet i went to bed and rose at early dawn to see them huddled together in a heap each merged into the other upon the lawn worn out by the sharp struggle fast asleep the sun shone brightly on them half the day by night they stealthily had stoln away ii and suddenly my thoughts then turned to you who came to me upon a winters night when snow sprites round my attic window flew your hair disheveled eyes aglow with light my heart was like the weather when you came the wanton winds were blowing loud and long but you with joy and passion all aflame you danced and sang a lilting summer song i made room for you in my little bed took covers from the closet fresh and warm a downful pillow for your scented head and lay down with you resting in my arm you went with dawn you left me ere the day the lonely actor of a dreamy play a woman for whom great gods might strive i said and kissed her there and then i thought of the other five and of how charms outwear i thought of the first with her eating eyes and i thought of the second with hers green gray and i thought of the third experienced wise and i thought of the fourth who sang all day and i thought of the fifth whom id called a jade and i thought of them all tear fraught and that each had shown her a passable maid yet not of the favour sought so i traced these words on the bark of a beech just at the falling of the mast after scanning five yes each and each ive found the woman desired at last i feel a strange benumbing spell as one ill wished said she and soon it seemed that something fell was starving her love for me i feel some curse o five were there and wanly she swerved and went away i followed sick night numbed the air and dark the mournful moorland lay i cried o darling turn your head but never her face i viewed o turn o turn again i said and miserably pursued at length i came to a christ cross stone which she had passed without discern and i knelt upon the leaves there strown and prayed aloud that she might turn i rose and looked and turn she did i cried my heart revives look more she said i looked as bid her face was all the fives all the five women clear come back i saw in her with her made one the while she drooped upon the track and her frail term seemed well nigh run shed half forgot me in her change who are you wont you say who you may be you man so strange following since yesterday i took the composite form she was and carried her to an arbour small not passion moved but even because in one i could atone to all and there she lies and there i tend till my lifes threads unwind a various womanhood in blend not one but all combined the reservoir is trying to freeze over with an expanding map shaped like an angel separated lovers on a coast keep walking toward each other low sun reddens their faces without heat they are weary of always moving so seldom touching but never think to move inland massive and stable imagoes hatched on thin ice its their illusion membranes are brighter than occluded flesh of interiors membranes have the density of an edge and edges violent as lava all day she walked across the tundra he began to drive away obliquely at exactly her speed so she altered her angle aiming above him as in a current he departed in a zone that solidified at his whim so she reached for his hand land cracked with their weight he seemed to reach toward her a hand like paper twisted and folded over only a surface with wan modulations like a map then she delicately stepped out toward the edge tenuous as a leaf as if waiting for a letter but it froze too swiftly before her at dusk his voice broke her concentration she turned vexed and saw he had not spoken never love unless you can bear with all the faults of man men sometimes will jealous be though but little cause they see and hang the head as discontent and speak what straight they will repent men that but one saint adore make a show of love to more beauty must be scorned in none though but truly served in one for what is courtship but disguise true hearts may have dissembling eyes men when their affairs require must awhile themselves retire sometimes hunt and sometimes hawk and not ever sit and talk if these and such like you can bear then like and love and never fear insomniac monkey mind ponders the dove symbol not only of peace but sexual love the couple nestled and brooding after coupling the human animal needs the woman safe for nine months and more but the man after his turbulent minute or two is expendable usefully rash reckless for defense in his void of redundancy willing to death and destruction monkey mind envies the male dove who equally with the female secretes pigeon milk for the young from his throat for peace send all human males between fourteen and twenty five to school on the moon or better yet mars but women too are capable of unpeace yes and we older men too venom throats heres a great comic who says on our journey we choose one of two tributaries the river of peace or the river of productivity the current of art he says runs not between banks with birdsong in the fragrant shadows no an artist must follow the stinks and rapids of the branch that drives the millstones and dynamos is peace merely a vacuum the negative of creation or the absence of war the teaching says peace is a positive energy still something in me resists that sweet milk my mind resembles my restless inferior cousin who fires his shit in handfuls from his cage like as a huntsman after weary chase seeing the game from him escapd away sits down to rest him in some shady place with panting hounds beguiled of their prey so after long pursuit and vain assay when i all weary had the chase forsook the gentle deer returnd the self same way thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook there she beholding me with milder look sought not to fly but fearless still did bide till i in hand her yet half trembling took and with her own goodwill her firmly tied strange thing me seemd to see a beast so wild so goodly won with her own will beguild nothing is nothing although he would call me that she was nothing those were his words but his hand was lifting cigarettes in chains and bridges of ash light he said he didnt want his body to last it wasnt a year i could argue against that kind of talk so i cut the fowl killed on the farm a mile out brown and silvery wild and put it over butter lettuce lettuce then lime i heated brandy in the saucepan poured a strip of molasses slowly through the cold slow as id seen a shaman pour pine tincture over the floor of my beaten house she seemed to see my whole life by ordinance of some god who wanted me alive again burnt sage blue smoke then sea salt shaken into the corners of violent sadness she wrote my address across her chest to let everything listening know where my life was made we waited either forgetting what we were or becoming more brightly human in that pine in her trance in the lavender i set on the chipped sills not a trance at all but my deliberate hand cutting from the yard part of what she required now wait longer she said and i did as i would when the molasses warmed over the pot enough to come into the brandy to come into the night begun by small confessions that this was just a rental and mine just a floor that the woman he loved was with another man his mother mad his apartment haunted in the crawl space then i told of the assault at daybreak between the houses heat asphalt all of it and my face toward the brick school where the apostolate studied first century script and song there must have been chanting as it was on the hour what we said was liturgy meant only for us and for that night not for anyone else to repeat live by believe never that our only theories were inside of our hands flesh and land body and prairie i reached to smoke down his next to last which he lit and made ready the poultry like a war ration we ate all the way through what we wished we said what we said we found that night by these and no other means by photographys gospel i thank you think you back you fail far away from me waving at pain a perfect song is loveless and here by your name things will never be the same are they the same yet its not hard to imagine my ancestor a dry season dust like chalk on her tongue mixes spit with clay traces a river on rock next day rain why shouldnt she believe in the power of rock and her own hand i carry this need for pattern and rule to see connections where there arent necessarily any after my first miscarriage i cut out soda cold cuts after the second vacuuming and air travel after the third its chalk and spit again i circle rocks swim the icy river and when my son is born he balances the chemical equation that is this world

at th the local went express i blistered home ten sockless humid blocks back to my solo digs for solo sex i got this poem for my bucks all master narratives of the mind in a rowboat and the rowboat as beautiful as the swamp glowing the dungeon state lily pads unfolding like riddles of water the plasticine heads of amphibians speckled skin of religious fervor and the razor blade weeds all master narratives of the body in a rowboat at the bottom of the swamp that has no hands all master narratives of the spirit in the rowboat sky reflecting the infant swamp clouds of filth soil knotted like tupelos and toppled alphabets all master narratives of the skin in a rowboat inside a pine coffin of swamp water all master narratives of thinking like a woman who says i choose inappropriate relationships all master narratives of dramatic structure in the soggy swamp against the humid flags beating the wind all master narratives of mythology like my son saying and then he turned into a very big wolf i think he was very sad he has feelings too you know i think he was sad because he got trapped inside the doors oh my god there are different fenrirs lokis fenrir met a different fenrir are wolves part of the cat family hey look up on your phone if they can change forms because these guys look different from the real fenrir see that white picture where hes up on top he turns huge and tries to eat the sun oh thats a tough fenrir i think he obeys the serpent now thats sad fenrir or maybe loki turns into the serpent oh loki are you a master of evil i think they can change forms the legendary muscle that wants and grieves the organ of attachment the pump of thrills and troubles clinging in stubborn colonies like pulpy shore life battened on a jetty slashed by the little deaths of sleep and pleasure they swell in the nurturing spasms of the waves sucking to cling and even in death itself baked frozen they shrink to grip the granite harder rid yourself of attachments and aversions but in her fathers orchard already he says hed like to be her bird and she says sweet yes yet i should kill thee with much cherishing showing that she knows already as art pepper that first time he takes heroin already knows that he will go to prison and that hell suffer and knows he needs to have it or die and the one who makes the general lose the world for love lets him say would i had never seen her but oh says enobarbus then you would have missed a wonderful piece of work which left unseen would bring less glory to your travels among the creatures in the rock torn surf a wave of agitation a gasp a scholar quips shakespeare was almost certainly homosexual bisexual or heterosexual the sonnets provide no evidence on the matter he writes romeo an extravagant speech on tears in the italian manner his teardrops cover his chamber window says the boy he calls them crystals inanely and sings them to juliet with his heart the almost certainly invented heart which buddha denounces in its endless changes forever jumping and moving like an ape over the poor beasts head the crystal fountain crashes illusions the cold salt spume of pain and meaningless distinction as buddha says but here in the crystal shower mouths are open to sing it is lee andrews and the hearts in singing i sit in my room looking out at the rain my tear drops are like crystals they cover my windowpane the turns of these illusions we make become their glory to buddha every distinct thing is illusion and becoming is destruction but still we sing in the shower i do in the beginning god drenched the emptiness with images the potter crosslegged at his wheel in benares market making mud cups another cup each second tapering up between his fingers one more to sell the tea seller at a penny a dozen and tea a penny a cup the customers smash the empties and waves of traffic grind the shards to mud for new cups in turn and i keep one here next to me holding it awhile from out of the cloud of dust that rises from the shattered pieces the risen dust alive with fire then settled and soaked and whirling again on the wheel that turns and looks on the world as on another cloud on everything the heart can grasp and throw away as a passing cloud with even enlightenment itself another image another cloud to break and churn a salt foam over the heart like an anemone that sucks at clouds and makes itself with clouds and sings in clouds and covers its windowpane with clouds that blur and melt until one clings and holds as once in the temple in the time before the temple was destroyed a young priest saw the seraphim of the lord each had six wings with two they covered their faces with two they covered their legs and feet with two they darted and hovered like dragonflies or perched like griffins in the shadows near the ceiling these are the visions too barbarous for heaven and too preposterous for belief on earth god sends to taunt his prophet with the truth no one can see that leads to who knows where a seraph took a live coal from the altar and seared the prophets lips and so he spoke as the record ends a coda in retard the hearts in a shifting velvety ah and ah prolonged again and again as lee andrews reaches ah high for i have to gain faith hope and charity god only knows the girl who will love me oh if we only could start over again then the hearts chant the chords again a final time ah and the record turns through all the music and on into silence again dark and amusing he is this handsome gallant of chamois polished charm athlete and dancer of uncommon talent is there cause for alarmin his smooth demeanor the proud tilt of his chin this cavaliere servente this harlequin gentle and kindly this other ardent but shy with an intelligencewho would not glory to be guided by and would it not make senseto trust in someone so devoted so worshipful as this tender pale pierrot since both of them delight if i must choose i win a matchless mate but by that very winning choice i lose i pause i hesitate putting decision off says columbine and while i hesitate they both are mine a clementineof inclement climategrows tart a crocustoo stoic to open wont like an oysterthat cloisters a spoil of pearls untouched the heart thats hadenoughstays shut music when soft voices die vibrates in the memory odours when sweet violets sicken live within the sense they quicken rose leaves when the rose is dead are heaped for the belov ds bed and so thy thoughts when thou art gone love itself shall slumber on farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou knowst thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter what none knows is when not if now that your life nears its end when you turn back what you see is ruin you think it is a prison no it is a vast resonating chamber in which each thing you say or do is new but the same what none knows is how to change each plateau you reach if single limited only itself in cludes traces of all the others so that in the end limitation frees you there is no end if you once see what is there to see you cannot see what is there to see not when she whose love you failed is standing next to you then as if refusing the know ledge that life unseparated from her is death as if again scorning your refusals she turns away the end achieved by the unappeased is burial within familiar spirit within whose care i grew within whose disappointment i twist may we at last see by what necessity the double bind is in the end the figure for human life why what we love is precluded always by something else we love as if each no we speak is yes each yes no the prospect is mixed but elsewhere the forecast is no better the eyrie where you perch in exhaustion has food and is out of the wind if cold you feel old young old young you scan the sea for movement though the promise of sex or food is the prospect that bewildered you to this end something in you believes that it is not the end when you wake sixth grade will start the finite you know you fear is infinite even at eleven what you love is what you should not love which endless bullies in tuit unerringly the future will be different you cannot see the end what none knows is when not if out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me whispering i love you before long i die i have travelld a long way merely to look on you to touch you for i could not die till i once lookd on you for i feard i might afterward lose you now we have met we have lookd we are safe return in peace to the ocean my love i too am part of that ocean my love we are not so much separated behold the great rondure the cohesion of all how perfect but as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us as for an hour carrying us diverse yet cannot carry us diverse forever be not impatient a little space know you i salute the air the ocean and the land every day at sundown for your dear sake my love bright star would i were stedfast as thou art not in lone splendour hung aloft the night and watching with eternal lids apart like natures patient sleepless eremite the moving waters at their priestlike task of pure ablution round earths human shores or gazing on the new soft fallen mask of snow upon the mountains and the moors no yet still stedfast still unchangeable pillowd upon my fair loves ripening breast to feel for ever its soft fall and swell awake for ever in a sweet unrest still still to hear her tender taken breath and so live ever or else swoon to death we arrived when the days grew legs of night chocolates were offered we ate latkes for hours to celebrate light and friends we will keep going despite dark or a madman in a white house dream lets talk about something else said the dog who begs faithfully at the door of goodwill a biscuit will do a voice of reason meat sticks i dreamed all of this i told her you me and paris it was impossible to make it through the tragedy without poetry what are we without winds becoming words becoming old children born to children born to sing us into love another level of love beyond the neighbors holiday light display proclaiming goodwill to all men who have lost their way in the dark as they tried to find the car door the bottle hidden behind the seat reason to keep on going past all the times they failed at sharing love love its weak they think or some romantic bullshit a movie set propped up behind on slats said the wizard of junk understanding who pretends to be the wise all knowing dog behind a cheap fan its in the plan for the new world straining to break through the floor of this one said the angel of all that you know and forgot and will find as she flutters the edge of your mind when you try to sing the blues to the future of everything that might happen and will all the losses come tumbling down down down at three in the morning as do all the shouldnt haves or should haves it doesnt matter girl ill be here to pick you up said memory in her red shoes and the dress that showed off brown legs when you met him at the age you have always loved hair perfect with a little wave and that shine in your skin from believing what was impossible was possible you were not afraid you stood up in love in a french story and there fell ever a light rain as you crossed the seine to meet him for caf in saint germain des pr s you wrote a poem beneath the tender skin from your ribs to your hip bone in the slender then and you are still writing that song to convince the sweetness of every bit of straggling moonlight star and sunlight to become words in your mouth in your kiss that kiss that will never die you will all ways fall in love it doesnt matter how old how many days hours or memories we can fall in love over and over again the seine or tennessee or any river with a soul knows the depths descending when it comes to seeing the sun or moon stare back without shame remorse or guilt this is what i remember she told her husband when they bedded down that night in the house that would begin marriage that house was built of twenty four doves rugs from india cooking recipes from seven generations of mothers and their sisters and wave upon wave of tears and the concrete of resolution for the steps that continue all the way to the heavens past guardian dogs dog after dog to protect they are humble earth angels and the rowdiest even nasty you try and lick yourself like that imagine and the old woman laughed as she slipped off her cheap shoes and parked them under the bed that lies at the center of the garden of good and evil shed seen it all done it more than once tonight she just wanted a good sleep and picked up the book of poetry by her bed which was over a journal she kept when her mother was dying these words from may sarton she kept in the fourth room of her heart love come upon him warily and deep for if he startle first it were as well to bind a foxs throat with a gold bell as hold him when it is his will to leap and she considered that every line of a poem was a lead line into the spirit world to capture a bit of memory pieces of gold confetti a kind of celebration we all want to be remembered even memory even the way the light came in the kitchen window when her mother turned up the dial on that cool mist color of a radio when memory crossed the path of longing and took mothers arm and she put down her apron said i dont mind if i do and they danced you watching as you began your own cache of remembering already you had stored the taste of mother as milk father as a labor of sweat and love and night as a lonely boat of stars that took you into who you were before you slid through the hips of the story there are no words when you cross the gate of forbidden waters or is it a sheer scarf of the finest silk or is it something else that causes you to forget nothing is ever forgotten says the god of remembering who protects the heartbeat of every little cell of knowing from the antarctic to the soft spot at the top of this planetary baby oh baby come here let me tell you the story of the party you will never forget no matter where you go where you are or where you will be when you cross the line and say no more no more greedy kings no more disappointments no more orphans or thefts of souls or lands no more killing for the sport of killing no more no more except more of the story so i will understand exactly what i am doing here and why she said to the fox guardian who took her arm to help her cross the road that was given to the care of natives who made sure the earth spirits were fed with songs and the other things they loved to eat they like sweets cookies and flowers it was getting late and the fox guardian picked up her books as she hurried through the streets of strife but it wasnt getting late there was no late only a plate of tamales on the counter waiting to be or not to be at this age said the fox we are closer to the not to be which is the to be in the fields of sweet grasses wherever you are enjoy the evening how the sun walks the horizon before cross sing over to be and we then exist under the realm of the moon theres where fears slay us in the dark of the howling mind we all battle befriend them the moon said as a crab skittered under her skirt her daughter in the high chair waiting for cereal and toast what a girl she turned out to be a willow tree a blessing to the winds to her family there she is married and we start the story all over again said her father in a toast to the happiness of who we are and who we are becoming as change in a new model sedan whips it down the freeway toward the generations that follow one after another in the original lands of the mvskoke who are still here nobody goes anywhere though we are always leaving and returning its a ceremony sunrise occurs everywhere in lizard time human time or a fern uncurling time we instinctually reach for light food we digest it make love art or trouble of it the sun crowns us at noon the whole earth is a queen then there are always goodbyes at sunset say goodbye to hurt to suffering to the pain you caused others or yourself goodbye goodbye to carrie fisher the star wars phenomenon and george michael the singer they were planets in our emotional universe some of my memories are opened by the image of love on screen in an imagined future or broken open when the sax solo of careless whisper blows through the communal heart yes theres a cosmic consciousness jung named it but it was there long before named by vedic and mvskoke scientists and there is a cosmic hearteousness for the heart is the higher mind and nothing can be forgotten there no ever or ever how do i sing this so i dont forget ask the poets each word is a box that can be opened or closed then a train of words phrases garnered by music and the need for rhythm to organize chaos like right here now in this poem is the transition phase i remembered it while giving birth summer sun bearing down on the city melting asphalt but there we were my daughter and i at the door between worlds i was happier than ever before to welcome her happiness was the path she chose to enter and i couldnt push yet not yet and then there appeared a pool of the bluest water we waited there for a breath to catch up and then it did and she took it that girl who was beautiful beyond dolphin dreaming and we made it we did to the other side of suffering this is the story our mothers tell but we couldnt hear it in our ears stuffed with barbie advertising with our mothers own loathing set in place by patriarchal scripture the smothering rules to stop insurrection by domesticated slaves or wives it hurt everybody the fathers cannot know what they are feeling in such a spiritual backwash worship boxes set into place by the need for money and power will not beget freedom only warships for freedom freedom oh freedom sang the slaves the oar rhythm of the blues lifting up the spirits of peoples whose bodies were worn out or destroyed by a mans slash hit of greed this is our memory too said america heredity is a field of blood celebration and forgetfulness dont take on more than you can carry said the eagle to his twin sons fighting each other in the sky over a fox dangling between them its that time of the year when we eat tamales and latkes we light candles fires to make the way for a newborn child for fresh understanding demons will try to make houses out of jealousy anger pride greed or more destructive material they place them in a part of the body that will hold them liver heart knee or brain so my friend lets let that go for joy for chocolates made of ashes mangos grapefruit or chili from oaxaca for sparkling wine from spain for these children who show up in our dreams and want to live at any cost because we are here to feed them joy your soul is so finely woven the silkworms went on strike said the mulberry tree we all have mulberry trees in the memory yard they hold the place for skinned knees earned by small braveries cousins you love who are gone a father cutting a watermelon in the summer on the porch and a mother so in love that her heart breaks it will never be the same yet all memory bends to fit the heart has uncountable rooms we turn to leave here and so will the hedgehog who makes a home next to that porch we become birds poems he does not think that i haunt here nightly how shall i let him know that whither his fancy sets him wandering i too alertly go hover and hover a few feet from him just as i used to do but cannot answer the words he lifts me only listen thereto when i could answer he did not say them when i could let him know how i would like to join in his journeys seldom he wished to go now that he goes and wants me with him more than he used to do never he sees my faithful phantom though he speaks thereto yes i companion him to places only dreamers know where the shy hares print long paces where the night rooks go into old aisles where the past is all to him close as his shade can do always lacking the power to call to him near as i reach thereto what a good haunter i am o tell him quickly make him know if he but sigh since my loss befell him straight to his side i go tell him a faithful one is doing all that love can do still that his path may be worth pursuing and to bring peace thereto in the years ive been at this lots not to be precise youd think that once or twiceat least i would have seensome anomalies i meansome major ones as innot feet but little wheels or crests like cockatiels where are they keeping the girlswith a chrome exterior or an extra derriere apparently nowhere assuming my samples valid the pool is limited to the standard types ive tallied such variance as there isin the usual congeriesof physiognomies and yet enough of it to be worth the looking at the walking by for that of the same girl over and overwould be no cross to bearif it were that one there en cuba tuve im tired of hearing your complaints all that whining about el exilio the tragedy of loss in cuba i had the catalogue of things the status the riches the opulence of it all i had a mate we were a pair our mistress was young we were young we would dangle on her ear concentrate on what you have forget the past and go out on the town mojitos at la floridita dancing at the tropicana and later no dont tell me about later in the jewel case an aqua tiffany box with white satin interior we tiffanys from new york i didnt know you would lie together in the pillowy luxury my ruby top layer and his aligned our bases please you neednt touching my diamond waist and his forming a continuous line sometimes we would switch backs id push i understand that in communities of exile the population my piercing needle through his back his through mine thats tends to lose ground politically as assimilation takes place that how i liked it best a little harsh but sweet tu y yo you and i is what she called us because our very longing is a constitutive ingredient of not only the condition of exile but body parts were paired he and i forming a single unit an i and a thou apart surely you have adjusted look youre mounted on a ring you are independent and prized very attractive for your age i might add we are nothing longing doesnt quite one adapts as to an amputation and la revoluci n dont make me vomit broadway past lincoln center and the wind is up so seems to

and everything her name written twice with in the middle the calligraphy of coupling she strode down the aisle to at last by etta james faced the celebrant like a keen soldier reporting for duty her voice shaky yet sure i do i do you may now kiss the mirror applause confetti every single one of the hundred and forty guests deemed the service unimprovable especially the vows so from the heart her wedding gown was ivory pointedly off white after all weve shared a bed for thirty two years she quipped in her first speech im hardly virginal if you know what i mean no one knew exactly what she meant not a soul questioned their devotion you only had to look at them hand cupped in hand smiling out of the same eyes you could sense their secret language bone deep blended blood toasts were frequent tearful one guest eyed his wife hovering harmlessly at the bar and imagined what his life mightve been if hed responded years ago to that offer in his head im the only one who will ever truly understand you marry me derek i love you marry me at the time he hadnt taken his proposal seriously he recharged his champagne flute watched the newlywed cut her five tiered cake both hands on the knife is it too late for us to try derek whispered to no one as the bride glided herself onto the dance floor taking turns first to lead then follow the twilight of your face the unknown bird in your voice draws me again to your eyes green vision your song about that longest moment a moon vulnerability a natalie i saw alone at carolyns party years ago where you called me to your side and i held my heart cupped in shadow as an offering to your smile our soft spoken isolation in prologue let me plainly say i shall not ever come to that discretion where i do not rage to think i grow decrepit bursten bellied bald and toothless thick of hearing tremulous of leg dry and rough barked as a hemlock slab the soft rot setting in and all my wheezy dreams the tunnelling of beetles in a raspy bark for now i am fleshed at smaller sports and grow in time into the mineral thick fell of earth vermont hairy with violets roses lilies and like minions and darlings of the spring meantime working wonders rousing astonishments and being a humble man i at the same time acknowledge my miscreate the nightshades cabbages and fleaworts of my plot though always i try to turn my back and scorn upon the inkhorn term and speak as is most commonly received with smile and wink and approbative nod not overfine nor at the same time reckless of the phrase nor ever ugly turdy tut mouthed but always joyous at the goosey brain the woolpack of the solid cloud a crowd a heap a troop a plume of trees grass gulls and rabbits in the end no doubt a vulgar prattle but the planet swells and bulges and protrudes beyond my eyes aversions and tottery fuddled always i give up i am not understood or wrongly out of some general assumption of my innocence this much i wish to say my nonesuch nosegay native sweet in someway plainer this is my letter to you and out of most severe purpose the bee the honey stalk the whole keep of the house endanger me the perspectives of the clapboard the steep falls of the lawn the razory apices of ridges and the abdominous curves of the meadow into the far trees there are ponds below the house and water runs the road crosses the water and the road diminishes to the reach of the next farm and the farm beyond that and two miles bearing right or left somewhere runs highway i have found my way with difficulty i am confused halfway i have suffered a failure of vital powers a swoon have been smirked at by the natives and misdirected fitting for i always dream of the painless redemption the return from fiasco and tumultuous journey to the transcendentally serene lawns of a transcendentally white house with columns of oak trees and iron deer and the affectionate greeting of one who has these many years waited in full patience without complaint for me to come in bleeding dusty and deliquescent from the fields the blade in my thigh or blinded the victim of fire or ravenous birds the lovely blood on my cheek like tears one limbed a bullet in my heart my hands my head cut off and the dark pulses of my blood diminishing yet never a reproach for my criminal self negligence my careless japeries and clumsy flounderings instead my brow is wiped my wounds attended to blood let leeches applied i heal i grow strong i can set forth again renewed valiant sturdy full of high spirits lively gay spruce in looks a reveler a merry prankster dimpled in the cheek from smiling perfect pilgrim fit for the chemistry of the resurrection yet i am of wild and changeful moods i am perhaps worthy of being stoned sometimes i lie hid and lurk in wait for the giggling girleries and leap out and shout and scatter them like chickens from the boot to the safe and flying four winds i am easy and fluent in the telling of lies and let it be said that i roar and sing scurrilous songs in base places and shall no doubt for this little vain merriment find a sorrowful reckoning in the end still my noises please me and what this wretched poet overmuch desires he easily believes it is his conventional cowardice it makes him immortally glad but then he always grows morose that is in his favor he repents lances his soul thinks of the willows and the columned porch and the wind melliloquent about the chimneys and you from where he sits now at the far end of this small porch of a federal farmhouse in this very and summery vermont i look down the pitches of the lawn fireflies make small explosions among the grass stems and i think that to walk down that slant of lawn to the black waters of the brook at the dark join of the cleft would be like dying and that if i die i will never pardon time i think my words will echo only in my own mind forever to what purpose i do not know i see a firefly trapped inside the screen i have no name for any of this i know it clearly in the same way i know the dead cry of the starlings in the eaves the smell of after rain the warm air holding in the hollows of the roads for this there is no name the holding mind is likewise without name that is the final thought it is the disorder the reason for all this the clouds begin to reach up blood mountain and i am sitting on a farmhouse porch and there are trees and it is late and i am dreaming that i dream i stare down into a fouled well and see the white legbones of a deer and the waters surface matte with loose hair the green stink welling and bellying from the fertile sump up and flowing outwards in a fountaining current of vines and melons and leaves and the knotgrass lawns blossoming with gilliflowers shoulder high cloud high the sun finally smothering in grass and then in the entire silence of this growth the grasses thickening darkening becoming clouds reaching up from the ridges and all night there is rain i dream that when i awaken it is a shining milky day four roosters are crowing in the yard and geese dabble in the green soft muds of the ditches this is the literal surface and for all the extravagance of what has gone before i now repent and make an image all of vermont each night blazes with fireflies the comet is a faint green phosphorescence to the north the catalpas blossom and each noon the sunlight hardens and the sky is a clear ground and i can look from my open doorway into dry and fiery yards you see i draw back always i cannot be understood o i wud slepe all the swete darkemans nor ever speke it was as if i had forgotten to see the steep lawns suddenly erupt in tiny lights it was as if my fingers burned green and blazed with crushed fireflies and as usual no deer appeared the strict edges of the meadow held nothing when i drive home my carlights sweep the road before me i override the long shadows of the pebbles and grasses and the sky grows long clouds i drive into the soft explosions of lightning far to the west at the end of the confusing road where i will sleep and awaken and sleep again my hands in the dashboard lights are glowing softly green this whole journey is before me i know i am touched with the phosphors of self love the light knows it is light a great red moon rides wedged in a crevice of clouds and i come up the widening road as if it is the driveway to your house when i was fair and young then favor graced me of many was i sought their mistress for to be but i did scorn them all and answered them therefore go go go seek some other where importune me no more how many weeping eyes i made to pine in woe how many sighing hearts i have not skill to show but i the prouder grew and still this spake therefore go go go seek some other where importune me no more then spake fair venus son that proud victorious boy saying you dainty dame for that you be so coy i will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more go go go seek some other where importune me no more as soon as he had said such change grew in my breast that neither night nor day i could take any rest wherefore i did repent that i had said before go go go seek some other where importune me no more along the field as we came by a year ago my love and i the aspen over stile and stone was talking to itself alone oh who are these that kiss and pass a country lover and his lass two lovers looking to be wed and time shall put them both to bed but she shall lie with earth above and he beside another love and sure enough beneath the tree there walks another love with me and overhead the aspen heaves its rainy sounding silver leaves and i spell nothing in their stir but now perhaps they speak to her and plain for her to understand they talk about a time at hand when i shall sleep with clover clad and she beside another lad i ruin my hats and all the mat slides glad i hop my girls and all is skip again i jump i run you up inside my truck the car goes looping out in dark and light and yellow hat slides in i run my mats and all the girl slides glad i hoped you skipped me into luck and jump me black ruin me glad i jump i run you up inside my truck i jump my slopes and all the dopes slide glad i glide my luck and all is slip again i jump my hopes and all the rope glides sad i skip you jump the way you said but i run old and sigh your name i ruin my mats and all the girl slides glad at least when luck hops it skips back again a rune my mats and all the girls slide glad i jump i run you up inside my truck after mad girls love song by sylvia plath my mare when she was in heat would travel the fenceline for hours wearing the impatience in her feet into the ground not a stallion for miles id assure her give it up shed widen her nostrils sieve the wind for news be moving again her underbelly darkening with sweat then stop at the gate a moment wait to see what i might do oh i knew how it was for her easily recognized myself in that wide lust came to stand in the pasture just to see it played offered a hand a bucket of grain a minutes distraction from passion the most i gave then shed return to what burned her the fence the fence so hoping i might see might let her free id envy her then to be so restlessly sure of heat and need and what it takes to feed the wanting that we are only a gap to open the width of a mare the rest would take care of itself surely surely i knew that who had the power of bucket and bridle she would beseech me sidle up be gone as life is short but desire desire is long things happen when you drink too much mescal one night with not enough food in my belly he kept on buying im a girl wholl fall damn near in love with gratitude and well he was hot and generous and so the least that i could do was let him kiss me hard and soft and any way you want it beast and beauty lime and salt sweet bacchus pards and when his friend showed up i felt so warm and generous i let him kiss me too his buddy asked me if it was the worm inside that makes me do the things i do i wasnt sure which worm he meant the one i ate the one that eats at me alone oh you the sprightliest most puggish the brightest star of all my lively loves all ladies to whom once i gave up my heart entire thenceforth yours to keep forever locked up in your own hearts tiniest room my best hope or to throw away carelessly at your leisure should that prove your best pleasure who is that dumpy matron decked out in worn faded shabby army fatigues which pooch out both before behind now screeching scoring me painfully in philistine commedia dellarte farce low summer fare across a pedestrian ferrys stretch of water in some meshugganah snug harbor and once more even fiercely pecking at me in the cold drab parish hall of manhattans landmark episcopal church where a once avant garde now grade school poetry project continues to dwell st marks church in the bouwerie whose stones hold in tight grip one wooden leg all of peter stuyvesants bones who is that midget witch who preens prances as she flaunts her lost wares otherwise hidden beneath some ancient boys flannel shirt its tail out flapping who is shrieking even now these mean words hey ted hey you fat god called me

your little cloud home ted pitiful she has a small purse removing it from one of her shopping bags she brings out from inside that small purse my withered heart lifting it high into the air over her head with her two hands she turns it upside down unzips its fasteners shakes it out over the plywood floor happily empty she cries loudly just like i always knew it would be empty empty empty i watch her and think thats not really you up there is it rose rochelle shelley o dont be sad little rose its still your ribbon i wear your favor tied to the grip of my lance when i ride out to give battle these golden days my mother is scared of the world she left my father after forty years she was like happy anniversary goodbye i respect that the moon tonight is dazzling is fullof itself but not quite full a man should not love the moon said milosz not exactly he translated himselfinto saying it a man should not love translation theres so much i cant know an hour ago marking time with someone i would like to like we passed some trees and there were crickets crickets chirping right off divisadero i touched his hand and for a cold momenti was like a child again nothing more nothing less we were apart yet day by day i bade my heart more constant be i bade it keep the world away and grow a home for only thee nor feard but thy love likewise grew like mine each day more tried more true the fault was grave i might have known what far too soon alas i learnd the heart can bind itself alone and faith may oft be unreturnd self swayd our feelings ebb and swell thou lovst no more farewell farewell farewell and thou thou lonely heart which never yet without remorse even for a moment didst depart from thy remote and spher e d course to haunt the place where passions reign back to thy solitude again back with the conscious thrill of shame which luna felt that summer night flash through her pure immortal frame when she forsook the starry height to hang over endymions sleep upon the pine grown latmian steep yet she chaste queen had never proved how vain a thing is mortal love wandering in heaven far removed but thou hast long had place to prove this truth to prove and make thine own thou hast been shalt be art alone or if not quite alone yet they which touch thee are unmating things ocean and clouds and night and day lorn autumns and triumphant springs and life and others joy and pain and love if love of happier men of happier men for they at least have dreamd two human hearts might blend in one and were through faith released from isolation without end prolongd nor knew although not less alone than thou their loneliness sleep she will not linger she turns her moon cold shoulder with no ring on her finger you cannot hope to hold her she turns her moon cold shoulder and tosses off the cover you cannot hope to hold her she has another lover she tosses off the cover and lays the darkness bare she has another lover her heart is otherwhere she lays the darkness bare you slowly realize her heart is otherwhere theres distance in her eyes you slowly realize that she will never linger with distance in her eyes and no ring on her finger either she was foul or her attire was bad or she was not the wench i wished thave had idly i lay with her as if i loved not and like a burden grieved the bed that moved not yet though both of us performed our true intent yet i could not cast anchor where i meant she on my neck her ivory arms did throw her arms far whiter than the scythian snow and eagerly she kissed me with her tongue and under mine her wanton thigh she flung yea and she soothed me up and called me sir and used all speech that might provoke and stir yet like as if cold hemlock i had drunk it mock d me hung down the head and sunk like a dull cipher or rude block i lay or shade or body was i who can say what will my age do age i cannot shun when in my prime my force is spent and done i blush that being youthful hot and lusty i prove neither youth nor man but old and rusty pure rose she like a nun to sacrifice or one that with her tender brother lies yet boarded i the golden chie twice and libas and the white cheeked pitho thrice corinna craved it in a summers night and nine sweet bouts we had before daylight what waste my limbs through some thessalian charms may spells and drugs do silly souls such harm with virgin wax hath some imbaste my joints and pierced my liver with sharp needles points charms change corn to grass and make it die by charms are running spring and fountains dry by charms mast crops from oaks from vines grapes fall and fruit from trees when theres no wind at all why might not then my sinews be enchanted and i grow faint as with some spirit haunted to this add shame shame to perform it quailed me and was the second cause why vigour failed me my idle thoughts delighted her no more than did the robe or garment which she wore yet might her touch make youthful pylius fire and tithon livelier than his years require even her i had and she had me in vain what might i crave more if i asked again i think the great gods grieved they had bestowed the benefit which lewdly i for slowed i wished to be received in in i get me to kiss i kiss to lie with her she let me why was i blessed why made king to refuse it chuff like had i not gold and could not use it so in a spring thrives he that told so much and looks upon the fruits he cannot touch hath any rose so from a fresh young maid as she might straight have gone to church and prayed well i believe she kissed not as she should nor used the sleight and cunning which she could huge oaks hard adamants might she have moved and with sweet words cause deaf rocks to have loved worthy she was to move both gods and men but neither was i man nor lived then can deaf ear take delight when phaemius sings or thamiras in curious painted things what sweet thought is there but i had the same and one gave place still as another came yet notwithstanding like one dead it lay drooping more than a rose pulled yesterday now when he should not jet he bolts upright and craves his task and seeks to be at fight lie down with shame and see thou stir no more seeing thou wouldst deceive me as before thou cozenest me by thee surprised am i and bide sore loss with endless infamy nay more the wench did not disdain a whit to take it in her hand and play with it but when she saw it would by no means stand but still drooped down regarding not her hand why mockst thou me she cried or being ill who bade thee lie down here against thy will either thou art witch with blood of frogs new dead or jaded camest thou from some other bed with that her loose gown on from me she cast her in skipping out her naked feet much graced her and lest her maid should know of this disgrace to cover it spilt water on the place i went to the garden of love and saw what i never had seen a chapel was built in the midst where i used to play on the green and the gates of this chapel were shut and thou shalt not writ over the door so i turnd to the garden of love that so many sweet flowers bore and i saw it was filled with graves and tomb stones where flowers should be and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds and binding with briars my joys desires perhaps her cook come under the influence of a few discreet piastres had spoken too indiscreetly or just perhaps on a hot day along the azure of the mediterranean rue fouad bearing a stream of traffic to muhammed ali square in a riot of klaxons and shouts and the whole city gleaming white as it must have from a distance perhaps on such a day someone got lucky and mme sperides at the customs house could sense what price she would have to pay that the official full of apologies and gold teeth would usher her into a private room smelling of dark tobacco that under the drone of the ceiling fans her valises would be searched the linings cut out the cowhide ripped back that despite her protests which would be useless but obligatory she herself would be stripped that finally two large diamonds worth a modest villa would peek and shine from the elegant crack of her ass whatever the story it was not for a boy to know i listened at my grandmothers door as she spoke in a whisper thieving a fragment here a word there naked jewels hidden you know where though i didnt and tried to call up all that i remembered mme sperides in her salon serving us tea and the small cucumber sandwiches whose flavor always reminded me of paste mme sperides falling easily back in her chair crossing her legs intoning you know what my husband left me it is not much to live on in these times mme sperides ringing for her servants who swished in and out in their galabiyas expressionless almost invisible bringing us fruits and petit fours and now mme sperides naked jewels hidden somewhere in my imagination somewhere in the words my grandmother whispered and i smuggled out with my ear at the door holding my breath thinking the world would suddenly reveal itself with one prize word some dark knowledge i love you mme sperides i tried with a small boys passion believing that was enough to bring her secretly to me translucent and shimmering but when i closed my eyes in my fever all i could see was mme sperides laden with rings and pearls bracelets and brooches mme sperides hidden by jewelry and clothing something else hidden beyond all that all i could taste was cucumber all i could hear was the undercurrent of long robes swishing from room to room he found her by the oceans moaning verge nor any wicked change in her discerned and she believed his old love had returned which was her exultation and her scourge she took his hand and walked with him and seemed the wife he sought though shadow like and dry she had one terror lest her heart should sigh and tell her loudly that she no longer dreamed she dared not say this is my breast look in but theres a strength to help the desperate weak that night he learned how silence best can speak the awful things when pity pleads for sin about the middle of the night her call was heard and he came wondering to the bed now kiss me dear it may be now she said lethe had passed those lips and he knew all morning green through ivy leaves resuscitated on window let us also breathe our own breath and the birds their blood in arrows settle into nest from migration the cloud of their song woke me stormed in me a waterfall in the thrushs call a star flick ering in the sparrows we are not the woods if we whisper the woods quietly to ourselves we witness our hands walking into the forest we are two rooms who think alone unless my ear saw the cardinal my eye heard the scarlet tanager i could not show it to you yesterday it existed as i exist now to you or the water pipit bobbing at burble of creek to one musical strand it heard and was harmony of and i saw from my distance the web we step through to enter woods spider sews one point to branch and leaps where wind carries sews one point of silk to fern and leaps to where wind carries until the web in logic sees the plank in pine do you see the house already built the oak desk i think at the dark cherry night stand for your closed book by the bed we keep a light to turn off do you hear our whole house swaying in the wind those birds are not crying out in fear those birds are singing nuptials outside our house already built in the green canopy the quoin of air illumined always as it illumines let us be truer fact asleep below love a leap no cornerstone no cement save song do you hear above us the river strong in leaves the rubble wind flows over and is not wind river the rubblesource the river ripples over to sing us and the silken nest weighs the beech branch down in horror the multi tude breathing in a single lung and one cocoon countless in turns the transparent ever winging itself past hunger glows as we glow is woven of one single thread and no love thinks separate the weaver from the wing i say now i love you with the worm in my mouth spinning my words into your ear and your listening volumes pupa in the elms crotch and oak knot do you hear as i hear the old sins blossom from diaries and become the faith leaves live upon we eat not ink but the light that burns in the blank page so ink can more unselfish sing so the wounded deer leaps highest so heart quickens my hand cocooned in your hand to become each one half a wing of luna moth waiting in woods for nights blossom the moon in borrowed light through dark unfathomed the dead stars light still lights on leaf a finite edge we loathe the bounded and nowhere witness a cosmos in fetters the woods lit by the lantern blown out our eyes by bright stars no longer thinking love is bright our woods and us some stars thought so the wild iris angles up in sun so sun is all stars and us the worm whose hunger sated in leaf again becomes hunger insatiable not for fact this world in which nothing in the eye the instant dead stars cast out countless shrouds mornings bright pall venus ascends ceaseless and wary the weak light one upon the other throws each moon waxing to each moon of the others face in full caught not in gazing at light we are what light gazes on lumen ensouling love so sigh so spiders feast by night so whippoorwills cry poor will so bobolinks wear the morning sun behind their heads unseen so light divides in two the star light sprang from and sews together again that star in us your sweet moan moon your linger languor your tongue on your lips not to speak so the moon glows on your lips in me the jack in pulpit blooms by night so i bloom so i give me to you so the appletree in flower proves not fruit but the sun in the mouth of the worm who grammars these woods into this world whose song is you are the kind of person who buys exotic fruits leaves them out on the counter until they rotyou always mean to eat them sometimes you rearrange them rousing over the bowl a cloud of tiny flies how do they balance the parrot who chews a walnut sideways holding it up in his right footthe owl perched on a just lit lamppost scratching behind its ear like a big dog your pencil eraser wears down long before the point for every word you write you rub out two where the slice of toast rested the plate is still warm a film of fog little points of dew love is like velocity we feel the speeding up and the slowing down otherwise not at allthe more steady the more it feels like going nowhere my love i want to go nowhere with you i cannot bring myself to toss the cup of cold coffee you set down by the door on your way to the taxiall day i have sipped it each time forgetting your two tablets of fake sugar too sweet running down the street dodging between raindrops plump as cherries the ground was feathered with wild strawberries i picked seven as many as i could beari ate two i saved the rest for you here hold out your hand take them taste how sweet please hold me the forgotten way the wall pleads spray paint face and voice of a damned poetthe darling damned poets save them from themselves maybe it is us they need saving from theres a place i know where the birds swing low and wayward vines go roaming where the lilacs nod and a marble god is pale in scented gloaming and at sunset there comes a lady fair whose eyes are deep with yearning by an old old gate does the lady wait her own true loves returning but the days go by and the lilacs die and trembling birds seek cover yet the lady stands with her long white hands held out to greet her lover and its there shell stay till the shadowy day a monument they grave her she will always wait by the same old gate the gate her true love gave her after you left me forever i was broken into pieces and all the pieces flung into the river then the legs crawled ashore and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow track they became for a while a simple roadside shrine a tiny table set up between the thighs held a dusty candle weed and fieldflower chains placed reverently there by children and old women my knees were hung with tin triangular medals to cure all forms of hysterical disease after i died forever in the river my torso floated bloated in the stream catching on logs or stones among the eddies white water foamed around it then dislodged it after a whirlwind trip it bumped ashore a grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks had already rescued my arms and put them by knowing everything has its uses sooner or later when he found my torso he called it his canoe and using my arms as paddles he rowed me up and down the scummy river when catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up and blessed his reusable bait clumsy but serviceable that canoe the trail of blood that was its wake attracted the carp and eels and the river turtle easily landed dazed by my tasty red a young lad found my head among the rushes and placed it on a dry stone he carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell and set small offerings before it which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night so it seemed i ate and the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets so my lungs would sigh and my dead tongue mutter attached to my throat like a sacred necklace was a circlet of small snails soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head with its waterweed crown seers found occupation interpreting sighs and their papyrus rolls accumulated meanwhile young boys retrieved my eyes they used for marbles in a simple game till somebodys pretty sister snatched at them and set them for luck in her bridal diadem poor girl when her future groom caught sight of her all eyes he crossed himself in horror and stumbled away in haste through her dowered meadows what then of my heart and organs my sacred slit which loved you best of all they were caught in a fishermans net and tossed at night into a pen for swine but they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded trampled one another in fear to get away and the fishermans wife who had thirteen living children and was contemptuous of holy love raked the rest of me onto the compost heap then in their various places and helpful functions the altar oracle offal canoe and oars learned the wild rumor of your return the altar leapt up and ran to the canoe scattering candle grease and wilted grasses arms sprang to their sockets blind hands with nibbled nails groped their way aided by loud lamentation to the bed of the bride snatched up those unlucky eyes from her discarded veil and diadem and rammed them home oh what a bright day it was this empty body danced on the riverbank hollow it called and searched among the fields for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun and never would have found them but then your great voice rang out under the skies my name and all those private names for the parts and places that had loved you best and they stirred in their nest of hay and dung the distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar and the seers pursuing my skull their lost employment and the tumbling boys who wanted the magic marbles and the runaway groom and the fishermans thirteen children set up such a clamor with their cries of miracle that our two bodies met like a thunderclap in midday right at the corner of that wretched field with its broken fenceposts and startled skinny cattle we fell in a heap on the compost heap and all our loving parts made love at once while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes and then went decently about their business and here it is moonlight again weve bathed in the river and are sweet and wholesome once more we kneel side by side in the sand we worship each other in whispers but the inner parts remember fermenting hay the comfortable odor of dung the animal incense and passion its bloody labor its birth and rebirth and decay her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss who therefore angry seems to part in sunder swelling on either side to want his bliss between whose hills her head entombed is where like a virtuous monument she lies to be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes without the bed her other fair hand was on the green coverlet whose perfect white showed like an april daisy on the grass with pearly sweat resembling dew of night her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light and canopied in darkness sweetly lay till they might open to adorn the day her hair like golden threads played with her breath o modest wantons wanton modesty showing lifes triumph in the map of death and deaths dim look in lifes mortality each in her sleep themselves so beautify as if between them twain there were no strife but that life lived in death and death in life her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue a pair of maiden worlds unconquer d save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew and him by oath they truly honour d these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred who like a foul usurper went about from this fair throne to heave the owner out what could he see but mightily he noted what did he note but strongly he desired what he beheld on that he firmly doted and in his will his willful eye he tired with more than admiration he admired her azure veins her alabaster skin her coral lips her snow white dimpled chin as the grim lion fawneth oer his prey sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied so oer this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay his rage of lust by gazing qualified slacked not suppressed for standing by her side his eye which late this mutiny restrains unto a greater uproar tempts his veins and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting in bloody death and ravishment delighting nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting swell in their pride the onset still expecting anon his beating heart alarum striking gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye his eye commends the leading to his hand his hand as proud of such a dignity smoking with pride marched on to make his stand on her bare breast the heart of all her land whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale left their round turrets destitute and pale they mustering to the quiet cabinet where their dear governess and lady lies do tell her she is dreadfully beset and fright her with confusion of their cries she much amazed breaks ope her locked up eyes who peeping forth this tumult to behold are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled imagine her as one in dead of night from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking what terror tis but she in worser taking from sleep disturb d heedfully doth view the sight which makes suppos d terror true wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears like to a new killed bird she trembling lies she dares not look yet winking there appears quick shifting antics ugly in her eyes such shadows are the weak brains forgeries who angry that the eyes fly from their lights in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights his hand that yet remains upon her breast rude ram to batter such an ivory wall may feel her heart poor citizen distressed wounding itself to death rise up and fall beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal this

i crossed a bridge was delicately creased and stained and stale like love disordered linen lovers here must meet on unsure ground like strangers in a circumspect hotel which although luxurious and grand trembles beneath their feet like earth in hell lifted on concentric gales scraps of paper leaves and gulls fluttered dismally aloft and groaned here darkness grows and light itself decays rain

angelic eyes human features cut in ice the spark you struck at once attained the fuse i recognize the vanity and scorn the fear the greed in short the mask of love familiar and disdainful and i turn

in your shoes and socks but the gaping holes in your personality when she asked me if i was uncomfortable i told her i wasnt i really was uncomfortable what i neglected to say was that i enjoy being

examined himself enough a hesitation hints at an attempt to be honest suggests a difficulty is present a good sentence needs a clause or two interruptions set off by commas evidence of a slowing down

thoughts full of concern he views the wise and daring conduct of the fight whilst each bold action to his mind renews his present glory and his past delight from his fierce eyes flashes of fire he throws as from black clouds when lightning breaks away transported thinks himself amidst the foes and absent yet enjoys the bloody day so when my days of impotence approach and im by pox and wines

and this last fairest tress of all so fair see ere i let it fall because you spend your lives in praising to praise you search the wide world over then why not witness calmly gazing if earth holds aught speak truth above her above this tress and this i touch but cannot praise i love so much she fears him and will always ask what fated her to choose him she meets in his engaging mask all reasons to refuse him but what she meets and what she fears are less than are the downward years drawn slowly to the foamless weirs of age were she to lose him between a blurred sagacity that once had power to sound him and love that will not let him be the judas that she found him her pride assuages her almost as if it were alone the cost he sees that he will not be lost and waits and looks around him a sense of ocean and old trees envelops and allures him tradition touching all he sees beguiles and reassures him and all her doubts of what he says are dimmed with what she knows of days till even prejudice delays and fades and she secures him the falling leaf inaugurates the reign of her confusion the pounding wave reverberates the dirge of her illusion and home where passion lived and died becomes a place where she can hide while all the town and harbor side vibrate with her seclusion we tell you tapping on our brows the story as it should be as if the story of a house were told or ever could be well have no kindly veil between her visions and those we have seen as if we guessed what hers have been or what they are or would be meanwhile we do no harm for they that with a god have striven not hearing much of what we say take what the god has given though like waves breaking it may be or like a changed familiar tree or like a stairway to the sea where down the blind are driven i i wonder do you feel to day as i have felt since hand in hand we sat down on the grass to stray in spirit better through the land this morn of rome and may ii for me i touched a thought i know has tantalized me many times like turns of thread the spiders throw mocking across our path for rhymes to catch at and let go iii help me to hold it first it left the yellowing fennel run to seed there branching from the brickworks cleft some old tombs ruin yonder weed took up the floating weft iv where one small orange cup amassed five beetles blind and green they grope among the honey meal and last everywhere on the grassy slope i traced it hold it fast v the champaign with its endless fleece of feathery grasses everywhere silence and passion joy and peace an everlasting wash of air romes ghost since her decease vi such life here through such lengths of hours such miracles performed in play such primal naked forms of flowers such letting nature have her way while heaven looks from its towers vii how say you let us o my dove let us be unashamed of soul as earth lies bare to heaven above how is it under our control to love or not to love viii i would that you were all to me you that are just so much no more nor yours nor mine nor slave nor free where does the fault lie what the core o the wound since wound must be ix i would i could adopt your will see with your eyes and set my heart beating by yours and drink my fill at your souls springs your part my part in life for good and ill x no i yearn upward touch you close then stand away i kiss your cheek catch your souls warmth i pluck the rose and love it more than tongue can speak then the good minute goes xi already how am i so far out of that minute must i go still like the thistle ball no bar onward whenever light winds blow fixed by no friendly star xii just when i seemed about to learn where is the thread now off again the old trick only i discern infinite passion and the pain of finite hearts that yearn joy to the bridegroom and the bride that lie by one anothers side o fie upon the virgin beds no loss is gain but maidenheads love quickly send the time may be when i shall deal my rosemary i long to simper at a feast to dance and kiss and do the rest when i shall wed and bedded be o then the qualm comes over me and tells the sweetness of a theme that i neer knew but in a dream you ladies have the blessed nights i pine in hope of such delights and silly damsel only can milk the cows teats and think on man and sigh and wish to taste and prove the wholesome sillabub of love make haste at once twin brothers bear and leave new matter for a star women and ships are never shown so fair as when their sails be blown then when the midwife hears your moan ill sigh for grief that i have none and you dear knight whose every kiss reaps the full crop of cupids bliss now you have found confess and tell that single sheets do make up hell and then so charitable be to get a man to pity me weret aught to me i bore the canopy with my extern the outward honouring or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet forgoing simple savour pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent no let me be obsequious in thy heart and take thou my oblation poor but free which is not mixd with seconds knows no art but mutual render only me for thee hence thou subornd informer a true soul when most impeachd stands least in thy control i have had to write this down in my absence and yours these things happen thinking of a voice added i imagine a sympathy outside us that protects the message from what cant help being said the times youve kept your secret putting on glasses or glancing into a page with interest give again the hurt youve forgiven pretending to be one of us so the hope of love translates as a series of hidden moments where we like to think someone was fooled into it who was i then who filled these days with illegible warnings the marriages broken the land pillaged by speculators no word for a stranger this island where i thought the language was mine has left me lonely and innocent as you or that friend who let you copy his themes until the words became pictures of places you would never go forgive it then that so much of after depends on these the words which must find you off the page the concept is interesting to see as though reflected in streaming windowpanes the look of others through their own eyes a digest of their correct impressions of their self analytical attitudes overlaid by your ghostly transparent face you in falbalas of some distant but not too distant era the cosmetics the shoes perfectly pointed drifting how long you have been drifting how long i have too for that matter like a bottle imp toward a surface which can never be approached never pierced through into the timeless energy of a present which would have its own opinions on these matters are an epistemological snapshot of the processes that first mentioned your name at some crowded cocktail party long ago and someone not the person addressed overheard it and carried that name around in his wallet for years as the wallet crumbled and bills slid in and out of it i want that information very much today cant have it and this makes me angry i shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of avignon on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge i shall at last see my complete face reflected not in the water but in the worn stone floor of my bridge i shall keep to myself i shall not repeat others comments about me between the hands between the brows between the lips of love lily a spirit is born whose birth endows my blood with fire to burn through me who breathes upon my gazing eyes who laughs and murmurs in mine ear at whose least touch my colour flies and whom my life grows faint to hear within the voice within the heart within the mind of love lily a spirit is born who lifts apart his tremulous wings and looks at me who on my mouth his finger lays and shows while whispering lutes confer that eden of loves watered ways whose winds and spirits worship her brows hands and lips heart mind and voice kisses and words of love lily oh bid me with your joy rejoice till riotous longing rest in me ah let not hope be still distraught but find in her its gracious goal whose speech truth knows not from her thought nor love her body from her soul you might as well take a razor to your pecker as let a woman in your heart first they do the wash and then they kill you they flash their lights and teach your wallet to puke they bring it to you folded if you see her stepping between the coin laundry and your building over the slushy street and watch the clothing steam you cant wait to open up the door when she puts the stairs behind her and catch that warmth between you it changes into a baby heres to the little shitter the little linoleum lizard once he peed on me when i was changing him that one got a laugh from the characters i wasted all my chances with at popeyes establishment when it was over by the wonderland but its destroyed now and i understand one of those shopping malls that are like great monuments of blindness and folly stands there and next door the grimy restaurants of men with movies where they used to wear human faces the sad people from space but that was never me because everything in those days depended on my work listen im going to work was all i could say and drunk or sober i would put on the uniform of texaco and wade into my life i felt like a man of honor and substance but the situation was dancing underneath me once i walked into the living room at my sisters and saw that the two of them her and my sister had turned sometime behind my back not exactly fatter but heavy or squalid with cartoons moving across the television in front of them surrounded by laundry and a couple of coca colas standing up next to the iron on the board i stepped out into the yard of bricks and trash and watched the light light up the blood inside each leaf and i asked myself now what is the rpm on this mother where do you turn it on i think you understand how i felt im not saying everything changed in the space of one second of seeing two women but i did start dragging her into the clubs with me i insisted she be sexy i just wanted to live and i did some nights were so sensory i felt the starlight landing on my back and i believed i could set fire to things with my fingers but the strategies of others broke my promise at closing time once she kept talking to a man when i was trying to catch her attention to leave it was a negro man and i thought of black limousines and black masses and black hydrants filled with black water when the lights came on you could see all kinds of intentions in the air i thought i might smack her face or spill a glass but instead i opened him up with my red fishing knife and i took out his guts and i said here they are motherfucker nigger here they are there were people frozen around us the lights had just come on at that moment i saw her reading me and reading me from the end of the world where i saw her standing and the way the sacred light played across her face all i can tell you is i had to be a diamond of ice to manage right down the middle from beginning to end my life pours into one ocean into this prison with its empty ballfield and its empty preparations for never happen if she ever comes to visit me to hell with her i wont talk to her and my son can entertain himself god kill them both im sorry for nothing im just an alien from another planet i am not happy disappointment lights its stupid fire in my heart but two days a week i staff the max security laundry above the world on the seventh level looking at two long roads out there that go to a couple of towns young girls accelerating through the intersection make me want to live forever they make me think of the grand things of wars and extremely white quiet light that never dies sometimes i stand against the window for hours tuned to every station at once so loaded on crystal meth i believe ill drift out of my body jesus christ your doors close and open you touch the maniac drifters the fireaters i could say a million things about you and never get that silence out of time that happens when the blank muscle hangs between its beats that is what i mean by darkness the place where i kiss your mouth where nothing bad has happened im not anyone but i wish i could be told when you will come to save us i have written several poems and several hymns and one has been performed on the religious ultrahigh frequency station and it goes like this thou wast that all to me love for which my soul did pine a green isle in the sea love a fountain and a shrine all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers and all the flowers were mine ah dream too bright to last ah starry hope that didst arise but to be overcast a voice from out the future cries on on but oer the past dim gulf my spirit hovering lies mute motionless aghast for alas alas with me the light of life is oer no more no more no more such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore shall bloom the thunder blasted tree or the stricken eagle soar and all my days are trances and all my nightly dreams are where thy grey eye glances and where thy footstep gleams in what ethereal dances by what eternal streams her body is not so white as anemony petals nor so smooth nor so remote a thing it is a field of the wild carrot taking the field by force the grass does not raise above it here is no question of whiteness white as can be with a purple mole at the center of each flower each flower is a hands span of her whiteness wherever his hand has lain there is a tiny purple blemish each part is a blossom under his touch to which the fibres of her being stem one by one each to its end until the whole field is a white desire empty a single stem a cluster flower by flower a pious wish to whiteness gone over or nothing you wept in your mothers arms and i knew that from then on i was to forget myself listening to your sobs i was resolved against my will to do well by us and so i said without thinking in great panic to do wrong in ones own judgment though others thrive by it is the right road to blessedness not to submit to error is in itself wrong and pride standing beside you i took an oath to make your life simpler by complicating mine and what i always thought would happen did i was lifted up in joy the sorrow of true love is a great sorrow and true love parting blackens a bright morrow yet almost they equal joys since their despair is but hope blinded by its tears and clear above the storm the heavens wait to be seen but greater sorrow from less love has been that can mistake lack of despair for hope and knows not tempest and the perfect scope of summer but a frozen drizzle perpetual of drops that from remorse and pity fall and cannot ever shine in the sun or thaw removed eternally from the suns law with blackest moss the flower plots were thickly crusted one and all the rusted nails fell from the knots that held the pear to the gable wall the broken sheds lookd sad and strange unlifted was the clinking latch weeded and worn the ancient thatch upon the lonely moated grange she only said my life is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead her tears fell with the dews at even her tears fell ere the dews were dried she could not look on the sweet heaven either at morn or eventide after the flitting of the bats when thickest dark did trance the sky she drew her casement curtain by and glanced athwart the glooming flats she only said the night is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead upon the middle of the night waking she heard the night fowl crow the cock sung out an hour ere light from the dark fen the oxens low came to her without hope of change in sleep she seemd to walk forlorn till cold winds woke the gray eyed morn about the lonely moated grange she only said the day is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead about a stone cast from the wall a sluice with blackend waters slept and oer it many round and small the clusterd marish mosses crept hard by a poplar shook alway all silver green with gnarled bark for leagues no other tree did mark the level waste the rounding gray she only said my life is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead and ever when the moon was low and the shrill winds were up and away in the white curtain to and fro she saw the gusty shadow sway but when the moon was very low and wild winds bound within their cell the shadow of the poplar fell upon her bed across her brow she only said the night is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead all day within the dreamy house the doors upon their hinges creakd the blue fly sung in the pane the mouse behind the mouldering wainscot shriekd or from the crevice peerd about old faces glimmerd thro the doors old footsteps trod the upper floors old voices called her from without she only said my life is dreary he cometh not she said she said i am aweary aweary i would that i were dead the sparrows chirrup on the roof the slow clock ticking and the sound which to the wooing wind aloof the poplar made did all confound her sense but most she loathed the hour when the thick moted sunbeam lay athwart the chambers and the day was sloping toward his western bower then said she i am very dreary he will not come she said she wept i am aweary aweary oh god that i were dead best and brightest come away fairer far than this fair day which like thee to those in sorrow comes to bid a sweet good morrow to the rough year just awake in its cradle on the brake the brightest hour of unborn spring through the winter wandering found it seems the halcyon morn to hoar february born bending from heaven in azure mirth it kissed the forehead of the earth and smiled upon the silent sea and bade the frozen streams be free and waked to music all their fountains and breathed upon the frozen mountains and like a prophetess of may strewed flowers upon the barren way making the wintry world appear like one on whom thou smilest dear away away from men and towns to the wild wood and the downs to the silent wilderness where the soul need not repress its music lest it should not find an echo in anothers mind while the touch of natures art harmonizes heart to heart i leave this notice on my door for each accustomed visitor i am gone into the fields to take what this sweet hour yields reflection you may come tomorrow sit by the fireside with sorrow you with the unpaid bill despair you tiresome verse reciter care i will pay you in the grave death will listen to your stave expectation too be off today is for itself enough hope in pity mock not woe with smiles nor follow where i go long having lived on thy sweet food at length i find one moments good after long pain with all your love this you never told me of radiant sister of the day awake arise and come away to the wild woods and the plains and the pools where winter rains image all their roof of leaves where the pine its garland weaves of sapless green and ivy dun round stems that never kiss the sun where the lawns and pastures be and the sandhills of the sea where the melting hoar frost wets the daisy star that never sets and wind flowers and violets which yet join not scent to hue crown the pale year weak and new when the night is left behind in the deep east dun and blind and the blue noon is over us and the multitudinous billows murmur at our feet where the earth and ocean meet and all things seem only one in the universal sun it was when they determined that i had been born dead that my life became easier to understand for a long time i wondered why rooms felt colder when i entered them why nothing i said seemed to stick in anyones ear frankly why i never had any money i wondered why the cities i walked through drifted into cloud even as i admired their architecture as i pointed out the cornerstones marked the only songs i ever loved were filled with scratch dispatches from a time when dead ones like me were a dime a dozen i spent my life in hotels some looked like mansions some more like trailer parks or pathways toward a future i tried to point to but how could i point with nothing but a hand no hand ever matched with fingers that melted into words that no one read i rehearsed names that others taught me caravaggio robert brandom judith amber emmanuelle cat i got hungry the way only the dead get hungry the hunger that launches a thousand dirty wars but i never took part in the wars because no one lets a dead man into their covert discussions so i drifted from loft to cellar ageless like a ghost and america became my compass and europe became the way that dead folks talk in short who cares theres nothing to say because nobody listens theres no radio for the dead and the pillows seem like sand let me explain when youre alive as i understand it pillows cushion the head the way a lover might soothe the heart the way it works for me in contrast is everything is sand beds are sand the women i profess to love are sand the sound of music in the darkest night is sand and whatever i have to say is sand this is not for example a political poem because the dead have no politics they might have a hunger but nothing youve ever known could begin to assuage it by then of course theyd done plenty in the name of recklessness their word as well though incorrect for wilderness ah scutchweed rushlightitude if not why not strowbegone nor sheep fa la shall graze the way incredibly for most its still enough to have noticed a similar weather pattern between regret and the windy plains of remorse like that must make them the same or should or at least no more different than a fetish for being eaten alive and whole is apparently from the desire to leave loneliness behind forever a reasonable desire i suppose but in the end a useless one since actual loneliness isnt leavable love distracts from loneliness it doesnt crowd it from view some could almost see this eventually others chose not to some the luckiest arrived at then clung to that point in love where to be understood entirely stops being the main thing or a thing at all even they could let the nights unfurl before them one after the other each a seemingly vast underworld of damage they didnt have to talk about not anymore they agreed it was there now they hovered over it what light there was was their own we spend our morning in the flower stalls counting the dark tongues of bells that hang from ropes waiting for the silence of an hour we find a table ask for paella cold soup and wine where a calm light trembles years behind us in buenos aires only three years ago it was the last time his hand slipped into her dress with pearls cooling her throat and bells like these chipping at the night as she talks the hollow clopping of a horse the sound of bones touched together the paella comes a bed of rice and camarones fingers and shells the lips of those whose lips have been removed mussels the soft blue of a leg socket this is not paella this is what has become of those who remained in buenos aires this is the ring of a rifle report on the stones her hand over her mouth her husband falling against her these are the flowers we bought this morning the dahlias tossed on his grave and bells waiting with their tongues cut out for this particular silence i above the fresh ruffles of the surf bright striped urchins flay each other with sand they have contrived a conquest for shell shucks and their fingers crumble fragments of baked weed gaily digging and scattering and in answer to their treble interjections the sun beats lightning on the waves the waves fold thunder on the sand and could they hear me i would tell them o brilliant kids frisk with your dog fondle your shells and sticks bleached by time and the elements but there is a line you must not cross nor ever trust beyond it spry cordage of your bodies to caresses too lichen faithful from too wide a breast the bottom of the sea is cruel ii and yet this great wink of eternity of rimless floods unfettered leewardings samite sheeted and processioned where her undinal vast belly moonward bends laughing the wrapt inflections of our love take this sea whose diapason knells on scrolls of silver snowy sentences the sceptred terror of whose sessions rends as her demeanors motion well or ill all but the pieties of lovers hands and onward as bells off san salvador salute the crocus lustres of the stars in these poinsettia meadows of her tides adagios of islands o my prodigal complete the dark confessions her veins spell mark how her turning shoulders wind the hours and hasten while her penniless rich palms pass superscription of bent foam and wave hasten while they are true sleep death desire close round one instant in one floating flower bind us in time o seasons clear and awe o minstrel galleons of carib fire bequeath us to no earthly shore until is answered in the vortex of our grave the seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise iii infinite consanguinity it bears this tendered theme of you that light retrieves from sea plains where the sky resigns a breast that every wave enthrones while ribboned water lanes i wind are laved and scattered with no stroke wide from your side whereto this hour the sea lifts also reliquary hands and so admitted through black swollen gates that must arrest all distance otherwise past whirling pillars and lithe pediments light wrestling there incessantly with light star kissing star through wave on wave unto your body rocking and where death if shed presumes no carnage but this single change upon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn the silken skilled transmemberment of song permit me voyage love into your hands iv whose counted smile of hours and days suppose i know as spectrum of the sea and pledge vastly now parting gulf on gulf of wings whose circles bridge i know from palms to the severe chilled albatrosss white immutability no stream of greater love advancing now than singing this mortality alone through clay aflow immortally to you all fragrance irrefragably and claim madly meeting logically in this hour and region that is ours to wreathe again portending eyes and lips and making told the chancel port and portion of our june shall they not stem and close in our own steps bright staves of flowers and quills today as i must first be lost in fatal tides to tell in signature of the incarnate word the harbor shoulders to resign in mingling mutual blood transpiring as foreknown and widening noon within your breast for gathering all bright insinuations that my years have caught for islands where must lead inviolably blue latitudes and levels of your eyes in this expectant still exclaim receive the secret oar and petals of all love v meticulous past midnight in clear rime infrangible and lonely smooth as though cast together in one merciless white blade the bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits as if too brittle or too clear to touch the cables of our sleep so swiftly filed already hang shred ends from remembered stars one frozen trackless smile what words can strangle this deaf moonlight for we are overtaken now no cry no sword can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge slow tyranny of moonlight moonlight loved and changed theres nothing like this in the world you say knowing i cannot touch your hand and look too into that godless cleft of sky where nothing turns but dead sands flashing and never to quite understand no in all the argosy of your bright hair i dreamed nothing so flagless as this piracy but now draw in your head alone and too tall here your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam your breath sealed by the ghosts i do not know draw in your head and sleep the long way home vi where icy and bright dungeons lift of swimmers their lost morning eyes and ocean rivers churning shift green borders under stranger skies steadily as a shell secretes its beating leagues of monotone or as many waters trough the suns red kelson past the capes wet stone o rivers mingling toward the sky and harbor of the phoenix breast my eyes pressed black against the prow thy derelict and blinded guest waiting afire what name unspoke i cannot claim let thy waves rear more savage than the death of kings some splintered garland for the seer beyond siroccos harvesting the solstice thunders crept away like a cliff swinging or a sail flung into aprils inmost day creations blithe and petalled word to the lounged goddess when she rose conceding dialogue with eyes that smile unsearchable repose still fervid covenant belle isle unfolded floating dais before which rainbows twine continual hair belle isle white echo of the oar the imaged word it is that holds hushed willows anchored in its glow it is the unbetrayable reply whose accent no farewell can know love again wanking at ten past three surely hes taken her home by now the bedroom hot as a bakery the drink gone dead without showing how to meet tomorrow and afterwards and the usual pain like dysentery someone else feeling her breasts and cunt someone else drowned in that lash wide stare and me supposed to be ignorant or find it funny or not to care even but why put it into words isolate rather this element that spreads through other lives like a tree and sways them on in a sort of sense and say why it never worked for me something to do with violence a long way back and wrong rewards and arrogant eternity what of her glass without her the blank gray there where the pool is blind of the moons face her dress without her the tossed empty space of cloud rack whence the moon has passed away her paths without her days appointed sway usurped by desolate night her pillowed place without her tears ah me for loves good grace and cold forgetfulness of night or day what of the heart without her nay poor heart of thee what word remains ere speech be still a wayfarer by barren ways and chill steep ways and weary without her thou art where the long cloud the long woods counterpart sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill never seek to tell thy love love that never told can be for the gentle wind does move silently invisiblyi told my love i told my love i told her all my heart trembling cold in ghastly fearsah she doth departsoon as she was gone from me a traveller came by silently invisibly o was no deny st agnes eve ah bitter chill it was the owl for all his feathers was a cold the hare limpd trembling through the frozen grass and silent was the flock in woolly fold numb were the beadsmans fingers while he told his rosary and while his frosted breath like pious incense from a censer old seemd taking flight for heaven without a death past the sweet virgins picture while his prayer he saith his prayer he saith this patient holy man then takes his lamp and riseth from his knees and back returneth meagre barefoot wan along the chapel aisle by slow degrees the sculpturd dead on each side seem to freeze emprisond in black purgatorial rails knights ladies praying in dumb oratries he passeth by and his weak spirit fails to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails northward he turneth through a little door and scarce three steps ere musics golden tongue flatterd to tears this aged man and poor but no already had his deathbell rung the joys of all his life were said and sung his was harsh penance on st agnes eve another way he went and soon among rough ashes sat he for his souls reprieve and all night kept awake for sinners sake to grieve that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft and so it chancd for many a door was wide from hurry to and fro soon up aloft the silver snarling trumpets gan to chide the level chambers ready with their pride were glowing to receive a thousand guests the carved angels ever eager eyed stard where upon their heads the cornice rests with hair blown back and wings put cross wise on their breasts at length burst in the argent revelry with plume tiara and all rich array numerous as shadows haunting faerily the brain new stuffd in youth with triumphs gay of old romance these let us wish away and turn sole thoughted to one lady there whose heart had brooded all that wintry day on love and wingd st agnes saintly care as she had heard old dames full many times declare they told her how upon st agnes eve young virgins might have visions of delight and soft adorings from their loves receive upon the honeyd middle of the night if ceremonies due they did aright as supperless to bed they must retire and couch supine their beauties lily white nor look behind nor sideways but require of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire full of this whim was thoughtful madeline the music yearning like a god in pain she scarcely heard her maiden eyes divine fixd on the floor saw many a sweeping train pass by she heeded not at all in vain came many a tiptoe amorous cavalier and back retird not coold by high disdain but she saw not her heart was otherwhere she sighd for agnes dreams the sweetest of the year she dancd along with vague regardless eyes anxious her lips her breathing quick and short the hallowd hour was near at hand she sighs amid the timbrels and the throngd resort of whisperers in anger or in sport mid looks of love defiance hate and scorn hoodwinkd with faery fancy all amort save to st agnes and her lambs unshorn and all the bliss to be before to morrow morn so purposing each moment to retire she lingerd still meantime across the moors had come young porphyro with heart on fire for madeline beside the portal doors buttressd from moonlight stands he and implores all saints to give him sight of madeline but for one moment in the tedious hours that he might gaze and worship all unseen perchance speak kneel touch kiss in sooth such things have been he ventures in let no buzzd whisper tell all eyes be muffled or a hundred swords will storm his heart loves fevrous citadel for him those chambers held barbarian hordes hyena foemen and hot blooded lords whose very dogs would execrations howl against his lineage not one breast affords him any mercy in that mansion foul save one old beldame weak in body and in soul ah happy chance the aged creature came shuffling along with ivory headed wand to where he stood hid from the torchs flame behind a broad half pillar far beyond the sound of merriment and chorus bland he startled her but soon she knew his face and graspd his fingers in her palsied hand saying mercy porphyro hie thee from this place they are all here to night the whole blood thirsty race get hence get hence theres dwarfish hildebrand he had a fever late and in the fit he cursed thee and thine both house and land then theres that old lord maurice not a whit more tame for his gray hairs alas me flit flit like a ghost away ah gossip dear were safe enough here in this arm chair sit and tell me how good saints not here not here follow me child or else these stones will be thy bier he followd through a lowly arched way brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume and as she mutterd well a well a day he found him in a little moonlight room pale latticd chill and silent as a tomb now tell me where is madeline said he o tell me angela by the holy loom which none but secret sisterhood may see when they st agnes wool are weaving piously st agnes ah it is st agnes eve yet men will murder upon holy days thou must hold water in a witchs sieve and be liege lord of all the elves and fays to venture so it fills me with amaze to see thee porphyro st agnes eve gods help my lady fair the conjuror plays this very night good angels her deceive but let me laugh awhile ive mickle time to grieve feebly she laugheth in the languid moon while porphyro upon her face doth look like puzzled urchin on an aged crone who keepeth closd a wondrous riddle book as spectacled she sits in chimney nook but soon his eyes grew brilliant when she told his ladys purpose and he scarce could brook tears at the thought of those enchantments cold and madeline asleep in lap of legends old sudden a thought came like a full blown rose flushing his brow and in his pained heart made purple riot then doth he propose a stratagem that makes the beldame start a cruel man and impious thou art sweet lady let her pray and sleep and dream alone with her good angels far apart from wicked men like thee go go i deem thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem i will not harm her by all saints i swear quoth porphyro o may i neer find grace when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer if one of her soft ringlets i displace or look with ruffian passion in her face good angela believe me by these tears or i will even in a moments space awake with horrid shout my foemens ears and beard them though they be more fangd than wolves and bears ah why wilt thou affright a feeble soul a poor weak palsy stricken churchyard thing whose passing bell may ere the midnight toll whose prayers for thee each morn and evening were never missd thus plaining doth she bring a gentler speech from burning porphyro so woful and of such deep sorrowing that angela gives promise she will do whatever he shall wish betide her weal or woe which was to lead him in close secrecy even to madelines chamber and there hide him in a closet of such privacy that he might see her beauty unespyd and win perhaps that night a peerless bride while legiond faeries pacd the coverlet and pale enchantment held her sleepy eyd never on such a night have lovers met since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt it shall be as thou wishest said the dame all cates and dainties shall be stored there quickly on this feast night by the tambour frame her own lute thou wilt see no time to spare for i am slow and feeble and scarce dare on such a catering trust my dizzy head wait here my child with patience kneel in prayer the while ah thou must needs the lady wed or may i never leave my grave among the dead so saying she hobbled off with busy fear the lovers endless minutes slowly passd the dame returnd and whisperd in his ear to follow her with aged eyes aghast from fright of dim espial safe at last through many a dusky gallery they gain the maidens chamber silken hushd and chaste where porphyro took covert pleasd amain his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain her faltring hand upon the balustrade old angela was feeling for the stair when madeline st agnes charmed maid rose like a missiond spirit unaware with silver tapers light and pious care she turnd and down the aged gossip led to a safe level matting now prepare young porphyro for gazing on that bed she comes she comes again like ring dove frayd and fled out went the taper as she hurried in its little smoke in pallid moonshine died she closd the door she panted all akin to spirits of the air and visions wide no uttered syllable or woe betide but to her heart her heart was voluble paining with eloquence her balmy side as though a tongueless nightingale should swell her throat in vain and die heart stifled in her dell a casement high and triple archd there was all garlanded with carven imagries of fruits and flowers and bunches of knot grass and diamonded with panes of quaint device innumerable of stains and splendid dyes as are the tiger moths deep damaskd wings and in the midst mong thousand heraldries and twilight saints and dim emblazonings a shielded scutcheon blushd with blood of queens and kings full on this casement shone the wintry moon and threw warm gules on madelines fair breast as down she knelt for heavens grace and boon rose bloom fell on her hands together prest and on her silver cross soft amethyst and on her hair a glory like a saint she seemd a splendid angel newly drest save wings for heaven porphyro grew faint she knelt so pure a thing so free from mortal taint anon his heart revives her vespers done of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees unclasps her warmed jewels one by one loosens her fragrant boddice by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees half hidden like a mermaid in sea weed pensive awhile she dreams awake and sees in fancy fair st agnes in her bed but dares not look behind or all the charm is fled soon trembling in her soft and chilly nest in sort of wakeful swoon perplexd she lay until the poppied warmth of sleep oppressd her soothed limbs and soul fatigued away flown like a thought until the morrow day blissfully havend both from joy and pain claspd like a missal where swart paynims pray blinded alike from sunshine and from rain as though a rose should shut and be a bud again stoln to this paradise and so entranced porphyro gazd upon her empty dress and listend to her breathing if it chanced to wake into a slumberous tenderness which when he heard that minute did he bless and breathd himself then from the closet crept noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness and over the hushd carpet silent stept and tween the curtains peepd where lo how fast she slept then by the bed side where the faded moon made a dim silver twilight soft he set a table and half anguishd threw thereon a cloth of woven crimson gold and jet o for some drowsy morphean amulet the boisterous midnight festive clarion the kettle drum and far heard clarinet affray his ears though but in dying tone the hall door shuts again and all the noise is gone and still she slept an azure lidded sleep in blanched linen smooth and lavenderd while he forth from the closet brought a heap of candied apple quince and plum and gourd with jellies soother than the creamy curd and lucent syrops tinct with cinnamon manna and dates in argosy transferrd from fez and spiced dainties every one from silken samarcand to cedard lebanon these delicates he heapd with glowing hand on golden dishes and in baskets bright of wreathed silver sumptuous they stand in the retired quiet of the night filling the chilly room with perfume light and now my love my seraph fair awake thou art my heaven and i thine eremite open thine eyes for meek st agnes sake or i shall drowse beside thee so my soul doth ache thus whispering his warm unnerved arm sank in her pillow shaded was her dream by the dusk curtains twas a midnight charm impossible to melt as iced stream the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies it seemd he never never could redeem from such a stedfast spell his ladys eyes so musd awhile entoild in woofed phantasies awakening up he took her hollow lute tumultuous and in chords that tenderest be he playd an ancient ditty long since mute in provence calld la belle dame sans mercy close to her ear touching the melody wherewith disturbd she utterd a soft moan he ceasd she panted quick and suddenly her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone upon his knees he sank pale as smooth sculptured stone her eyes were open but she still beheld now wide awake the vision of her sleep there was a painful change that nigh expelld the blisses of her dream so pure and deep at which fair madeline began to weep and moan forth witless words with many a sigh while still her gaze on porphyro would keep who knelt with joined hands and piteous eye fearing to move or speak she lookd so dreamingly ah porphyro said she but even now thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear made tuneable with every sweetest vow and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear how changd thou art how pallid chill and drear give me that voice again my porphyro those looks immortal those complainings dear oh leave me not in this eternal woe for if thy diest my love i know not where to go beyond a mortal man impassiond far at these voluptuous accents he arose ethereal flushd and like a throbbing star seen mid the sapphire heavens deep repose into her dream he melted as the rose blendeth its odour with the violet solution sweet meantime the frost wind blows like loves alarum pattering the sharp sleet against the window panes st agnes moon hath set tis dark quick pattereth the flaw blown sleet this is no dream my bride my madeline tis dark the iced gusts still rave and beat no dream alas alas and woe is mine porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine cruel what traitor could thee hither bring i curse not for my heart is lost in thine though thou forsakest a deceived thing a dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing my madeline sweet dreamer lovely bride say may i be for aye thy vassal blest thy beautys shield heart shapd and vermeil dyed ah silver shrine here will i take my rest after so many hours of toil and quest a famishd pilgrim savd by miracle though i have found i will not rob thy nest saving of thy sweet self if thou thinkst well to trust fair madeline to no rude infidel hark tis an elfin storm from faery land of haggard seeming but a boon indeed arise arise the morning is at hand the bloated wassaillers will never heed let us away my love with happy speed there are no ears to hear or eyes to see drownd all in rhenish and the sleepy mead awake arise my love and fearless be for oer the southern moors i have a home for thee she hurried at his words beset with fears for there were sleeping dragons all around at glaring watch perhaps with ready spears down the wide stairs a darkling way they found in all the house was heard no human sound a chain droopd lamp was flickering by each door the arras rich with horseman hawk and hound flutterd in the besieging winds uproar and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor they glide like phantoms into the wide hall like phantoms to the iron porch they glide where lay the porter in uneasy sprawl with a huge empty flaggon by his side the wakeful bloodhound rose and shook his hide but his sagacious eye an inmate owns by one and one the bolts full easy slide the chains lie silent on the footworn stones the key turns and the door upon its hinges groans and they are gone ay ages long ago these lovers fled away into the storm that night the baron dreamt of many a woe and all his warrior guests with shade and form of witch and demon and large coffin worm were long be nightmard angela the old died palsy twitchd with meagre face deform the beadsman after thousand aves told for aye unsought for

were a wonder so between them love did shine that the turtle saw his right flaming in the phoenix sight either was the others mine property was thus appalled that the self was not the same single natures double name neither two nor one was called reason in itself confounded saw division grow together to themselves yet either neither simple were so well compounded that it cried how true a twain

careless and disdainful eyes of proud adonis that before her lies her kirtle blue whereon was many a stain made with the blood of wretched lovers slain upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath from whence her veil reachd to the ground beneath her veil was artificial flowers and leaves whose workmanship both man and beast deceives many would praise the sweet smell as she past when twas the odour which her breath forth cast and there for honey bees have sought in vain and beat from thence have lighted there again about her neck hung chains of pebble stone which lightend by her neck like diamonds shone she ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind would burn or parch her hands but to her mind or warm or cool them for they took delight to play upon those hands they were so white buskins of shells all silverd used she and branchd with blushing coral to the knee where sparrows perchd of hollow pearl and gold such as the world would wonder to behold those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills which as she went would chirrup through the bills some say for her the fairest cupid pind and looking in her face was strooken blind but this is true so like was one the other as he

so was his neck in touching and surpast the white of pelops shoulder i could tell ye how smooth his breast was and how white his belly and whose immortal fingers did imprint that heavenly path with many a curious dint that runs along his back but my rude pen can hardly blazon forth the loves of men much less of powerful gods let it suffice that my slack muse sings of leanders eyes those orient cheeks and lips exceeding his that leapt into the water for a kiss of his own shadow and despising many died ere he could enjoy the love of any had wild hippolytus leander seen enamourd of his beauty

but far above the loveliest hero shind and stole away th enchanted gazers mind for like sea nymphs inveigling harmony so was her beauty to the standers by nor that night wandering pale and watery star when yawning dragons draw her thirling car from latmus mount up to the gloomy sky where crownd with blazing light and majesty she proudly sits more over rules the flood than she the hearts of those that near her stood even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase wretched ixions shaggy footed race incensd with savage heat gallop amain from steep pine bearing mountains to the plain so ran the people forth to gaze upon her and all that viewd her were enamourd on her and as in fury of a dreadful fight their fellows being slain or put to flight poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead strooken so at her presence all surprisd and tooken await the sentence of her scornful eyes he whom she favours lives the other dies there might you see one sigh another rage and some their violent passions to

lose the other win and one especially do we affect of two gold ingots like in each respect the reason no man knows let it suffice what we behold is censurd by our eyes where both deliberate the love is slight who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight since theres no help come let us kiss and part nay i have done you get no more of me and i am glad yea glad with all my heart that thus so cleanly i myself can free shake hands for ever cancel all our vows and when we meet at any time again be it not seen in either of our brows that we one jot of former love retain now at the last gasp of loves

like young men running always in the heart she loved others had lived she heard their laughter she lies where none has lain before where certainly none will follow after is that an attitude for a flower to stand like a club at the walk poor slain boy is that a way to show gratitude to the gods white with colored hearts the tall flowers sway around you all the other boys in the cold spring as the violets open there were no flowers in antiquity but boys bodies pale perfectly imagined so the gods sank to human shape with longing in the field in the willow grove apollo sent the courtiers away and from the blood of the wound a flower sprang lilylike more brilliant than the purples of tyre then the god wept his vital grief flooded the earth beauty dies that is the source of creation outside the ring of trees the courtiers could hear the doves call transmit its uniform its inborn sorrow they stood listening among the rustling willows was this the gods lament they listened carefully and for a short time all sound was sad there is no other immortality in the cold spring the purple violets open and yet the heart is black there is its violence frankly exposed or is it not the heart at the center but some other word and now someone is bending over them meaning to gather them they could not wait in exile forever through the glittering grove the courtiers ran calling the name of their companion over the birds noise over the willows aimless sadness well into the night they wept their clear tears altering no earthly color where do you want my heart now placed next to yours on your pale skin so that i will fall in love with your sweaty pain i have heard your bones crack the dry cement that leafed the frenzied spirit within i witnessed its wildness escape into your body screaming kissy words while your fingers plucked at my guitar your eyes were koyotis ska la las trying to rip a path to my soul i froze there in my manly state knowing theres nothing that i can do if there is a word in the lexicon of love it will not declare itself the nature of words is to fail men who fall in love with men it will not declare itself the perfect word boyfriend seems ridiculous men who fall in love with men deserve something a bit more formal the perfect word boyfriend ridiculous but partner is businesslike we deserve something a bit less formal much more in love with love but if partner is businesslike then lover suggests only sex is too much in love with love there is life outside of the bedroom and lover suggests only sex we are left with roommate or friend there is life but outside of the bedroom my friend and i rarely speak of one another to my left is my roommate my friend if there is a word in the lexicon of love my friend and i rarely speak it of one another the nature of words is to fail let it be said that tims year was divided into two seasons sneakers and flip flops let us remember that tim would sometimes throw a football with all the requisite grip angle and spiral talk let us recall that for the sake of what was left of appearances my mother never once let him sleep in her bed he snored all over our dog chewed couch and in the mornings when i tip toed past him on my way to school his jowls fat as a catchers mitt i never cracked an empty bottle across that space where his front teeth rotted out nor did i touch a struck match to that mole by his lip whiskery dot that he believed made him irresistable to all lovelorn women still let us remember sweetness tim lying face down mom popping the zits that dotted his broad sun spotted back which though obviously gross gets the january photo in my personal wall calendar of what love should be if such a calendar could still exist above my kitchen table junked up with the heretos and therefores from my last divorce let us not forget how my mother would slip into her red cocktail dress and tim would say your mother is beautiful before getting up to go dance with someone else in fairness let me confess that i pedaled my ten speed across the leaf river bridge all the way to tims other womans house and lay with that womans daughter beside the moon cold weight of the propane tank dumb with liquor numb to the fire ants that we spread our blanket over until i stopped for a second and looked up because i wondered if her mother could hear us or if tim might not have stood in the kitchen maybe looked out the window and saw my white ass pumping in the moonlight and whispered to himself thats my boy ke pwoahn pohnpei i told him as we kissedis that a good thing he askedhell yea i wanted to say replaced it with another kiss inhaling the mix of last nights sakau en pohnpei seir en wai sweat rain intoxicating taking me home he left that smell behind it would barely linger by the time he reached his destination i was headed for it so the smell stayed bittersweet and blue on my skin in my hair i carried it with me there where it grew mixed with mangoes coughs handshakes pigs babies and old people im back it now reeks wont wash away with the other smells get in my car it hits me pungent remnants of the mwaramwar he left behind sex is always monstrous blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body please touch me there more oh god for a hitchhiker the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift itchy unsafe space on the verge of a new mexico highway it is often the sex of another era in which the socks and dress shirt blouse are not necessarily removed i hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me ultra american like a christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand name anti inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick at first my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian after all it is not really hitchhiking to buy a greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons again this is an example of departure in another time as a foreign student on scholarship it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on salman rushdies early works nevertheless how can we keep tabs on these ji visa holders who come over here and the university as an institution really needs to be more accountable we need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information they need to do their course work and then they need to go home i didnt want to go home this is a boring sentence perhaps for you oregon is a calming word evoking images of blackberry pie ocean vistas and the capture of suspected felons i had never heard the word oregon before like the distance of scotland from london it seemed impossibly far a beautiful hazard to go and keep going how can i put this in england nobody ever ever ever did this i who once drove straight to glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar in a dinged up datsun cherry was considered an anomaly are you demented why do you want to drive in a car to bloody scotland its seven hours on the m man though outwardly i was wan and somewhat reticent i no i was my sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in hyde park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the london school of economics that my breasts in that position from that angle resembled two fried eggs we were meeting in a park as per the era i am sure contemporary punjabi british teenagers are fearless individuals undaunted by the prospect of community censure back then we met by the iron wrought gate on a park bench on a path built for seventeenth century promenades it is always a century in my century sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like scotland or wales and borrowing my fathers car forever are you out of your bleeding head your dads going to skin you alive in some sense this driving is the opposite of hitchhiking in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar the day was real in a different way back then in the way that it sensitized me to risk a kind of twin to permisson two black swans that day and this one history and fiction what i went for and what i really wanted which i didnt know until i got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible considering the trouble i was already in and the rain which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets the streetlamps were pink on prince street in glasgow i saw the sign for american style pizza and went down the steps to the basement caf the tables were coated with green plastic there was hot tea which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as i focused my eye on a laminated print of a white blocky rose with a pink dot at its center charles rennie mackintosh the waitress pronouncing osh so that it rhymed with horse are you from india would you like some jam with that scone i bet they dont have scones in india do they more tea i heard you have a lot of tea over there isnt that right plan b the extension of my throat the euphoria of theft other countries with their sayings and beliefs the original plan formulated by my father during his morning communte across london marrying a british born hindu brahmin dentist with brown skin but not too brown and rosy cheeks note on the mantelpiece tucked behind the marble figurine of shiva what is forthcoming under the original plan extraction what kind of sex is possible on the dentists chair late at night for that girl your girl who nervously asks for a blanket she has her socks on shes shivering it is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients but in this scene the limbs of the dentists young asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen scented nail polish or mouthwash dad please dont swallow rinse then spit spit then swallow i could not go home and so after a brief visit to the hill house charles rennie mackintoshs art deco home on the firth of clyde where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy as it seemed from the d cor i turned left and kept driving i drove my car into the atlantic and kept driving my chest very tight beneath the surface it was difficult to feel anything or really to see and so i can only say that i went into a damaging ocean this is going damaged washed up on the mythical shores of new jersey a few days later my car failed to start this is later when the car stopped and looking up from my hands white knuckled on the steering wheel i realized that i was okay now i am here in the future of color im sorry i do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival i am not interested in it i do not recall it i it was only when my car stopped that i realized what i had to do on my own terms with my own two legs get going is that how you say it get up and go the destiny of my body as separate from my childhood i came here to hitchhike i came here to complete a thing i began in another place removing wet pages from my rucksack i lay them on the shore securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles when they dried i folded them into squares and put them in my pocket next to my body misshapen exhilarated i said get i said go get up now and go are you okay do you need a ride somewhere let me look in the trunk i might have something in there here you go youre shivering do you need to go to the hospital at least let me buy you a cup of coffee my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a waterd shoot my heart is like an apple tree whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit my heart is like a rainbow shell that paddles in a halcyon sea my heart is gladder than all these because my love is come to me raise me a dais of silk and down hang it with vair and purple dyes carve it in doves and pomegranates and peacocks with a hundred eyes work it in gold and silver grapes in leaves and silver fleurs de lys because the birthday of my life is come my love is come to me all night long i hear the sleepers toss between the darkened window and the wall the madmans whimper and the lovers voice the workers whisper and the sick childs call knowing them all id walk a mile maybe hearing some cat crying its guts out to throttle it by hand such simple love i had i wished i might or god might answer each call in person and each poor demand well id have been better off sleeping myself these fancies had some sentimental charm but love without direction is a cheap blanket and even if it did no one any harm no one is warm the sniper at work over the street corner acts two girls breathless after the dash across radiate heat and bouquets as when ironing silken delicates with one in place of a chignon goosefleshed christmas wheat she explodes rages curses the sniper at the window seemingly im watching a beautiful storm from the other words like a sun umbrellas flutterings in the morning on an adriatic beach now and again she flicks her head back just for us as she well knows flicked hair sweetens the air beauty always forthcoming never misses a half smile as they well know making us happy costs them nothing those half smiles saying you arent just one fact among others not at all not for them even banishing the hex of that fact if any other womans glacial look had magicked it up the air smelt strongly of my distant youth when every boulevard led to the end of the world when life was not yet threadbare as a proverb now theyre going leaving such tenderness in me as engulfs you when looking too long at the heavens into which snowflakes are swarming so they disappeared chattering not girls but breezes blown lightly surprisingly through the st johns heat of siege the st johns heat of being so many names my mother im never sure what to call you so many names for all your predators and crushes and suitors im sorry im sorry im here and im sorry im not here would you have made it on your own without the comorbid condition of motherhood and the slowness and consistency of time im sorry for the slowness and consistency of time years like zombies dawdling toward a cliff edge holding back the childs writhing body itching to grow packed around the same mind i have now im sorry the concept of promise outgrew the concept of child and that systemic contradiction and wizardry left only a dim sense of suspicion a crescendoing breeze accumulating clouds amidst bewildering dichotomies im sorry for resembling your relatives and captors and the man who penetrated you whos still there communicating boldly via intersections of others thought waves and memories blatant into the long nights haunting for my inferiority in the face of nuclear family culture feeding on detritus of white goods leisure sports laminate oors a real home and fake recycling for creeping by night into a tight void blinds down brain blown glass thin electric impulses and bloated thoughts bolted in for this life being the only one my quiet mind knows its many versions and phases im sorry i wasnt your daughter or anyone when you were the blue water navy or the beheaded or the baby boy or was i im sorry i was not yet born and could not yet hear you when you were over there listening carefully for the rain and small movements of animals for sounds of life through a green ve ngered haze im sorry i consider sentiment fact authenticity originality when they are irrelevant so many choices in supermarkets the natural habitat of panic attacks its enough to make anyone sorry and i am im sorry its taking over half a century to link your purple patched brain scan to the basic biology of stress the piano thunders on sustain pedal wired to the facial muscles of all your neglecters aching like hell behind their stamina and machinery im sorry i had logically to think of my own self rst simultaneously navigating through the re and acid of trust and her sycophant love before returning all the powerful were women the power of penises and facial hair originated there cajoled by matriarchs as if skin and breath were insigni cant im so sorry where are you now to take into my arms and resuscitate is it too late given youre fty and no longer a child its always mothers and mind control which is whyi thank you for breaking the cycle withstanding the enormity of generations magnetic as water to let us go you werent to know about other outrageous families and sadistic counterparts a nugget of my limbic system remembered choosing my own lemon yellow baby clothes so thank you i squeezed that into the thumb sized space in the palm of my hand knowing all along they were wrong and imploding with it im sorry i wept in the shower for your canceled wedding letting the violet dress down the plughole unsure what it all meant except things staying the same future aggravating my brain a baby brother gone again im sorry you were out there alone de ned by the worst of others and de ned by your childrens prisms of hope and survival mechanisms in one version you did marry and lived in a house with green walls and extravagant furniture im sorry that consensus reality had you set re to your bed as you lay in it arrested put in a cell let off the next day because the lawyer believed it was a genuine attempt and convinced the police im sorry youve had to withstand such torrents of knowledgeless advice and legal toxi cation clinging to reality by a sinew of tooth remembering yourself through the rough and the smooth im sorry i was absent memorizing books of the bible for a bar of dairy milk owning up to things id never done getting con rmed as an antidote to the evil core of me im sorry it was exotic to think of kids like me ending up in prison coincidentally inevitably or prevented which is the same salvaged peristalsized through society brain safely contained doused daily in cold water or electricity or disgrace temptations kept consistently far enough away as to appear illusory like you my brave mother fantastic prodigy in owing white caftan knotted long brown hair a beautiful gaze of solemnity rare stone emotionless de ned by others im sorry i was ill prepared for your soiled mattress and comatose body under a wave of advocaat and transistor radios oozing with cheap scotch even i developed feelings for them amidst adults acting like its okay to leave you this way the blue bottle ies in on it in ated with dog shit and red hot egos resting on your cheek your lip too cunning to get rid of im sorry that laughing off a difficult childhood didnt make it never happen even a basic calculator recognizes an in nite loop as a malfunction dont they see cutting off my privates every night needs additional information im sorry i talked you out of wounding yourself although i know it feels hopeful and lets in sunlight and air through an open door im sorry i cant help you go up i also dont know how im sorry i prioritize the stimulation of adrenalin and opioids in my own axis before i come to you thank you for believing i love you even though you know i dont know love or trust it i dreamed a baby died from kidney failure the worst part not knowing distress from relief in the face of the mother like a child in an experiment what does this mean my man fearing a moment of madness not locking the knives away but keeping a steady eye on them paying attention to the moon and turning moods he underestimates me im my own doppelg nger here i am locked to him discussing sex positions and holiday destinations here i am courting solitude in the doorway a pair of eyes and a chest cavity thrumming on the dark boundary between survival and self control while there are no babies i carry on i am testament to the problem of the baby look at me aunting my own survival who am i except the parasite that accidentally caught on to your womb wall as you lay stoned on a fur lined coat in a hallway in moss side happy accident accidentally on purpose close the piano lid empty a drawer things happen im sorry for absences holidaying in france studying guilt time traveling the pain barrier intent on nerve endings and their connections to various biological systems learning to accept and relinquish responsibility appropriately throwing back the hot stone in a horizontal line thank you to the policeman who took all the men whose safety you feared for to the pub so you could come home for dinner monologue nail varnish remover a set of impartial weighing scales and cheap french wine im sorry about the home the wine the monologue resonating against the plastic mug others might keep for you fussing over makeup smeared walls upholstery and understatements im a bit sad we cant see al he comes on the radio sometimes im sorry im not bringing you home nally to thrive and repair i wanted to stay singing luther vandross on the walkway outside at a m fetching toast from the neighbor i was hoping for perfection believing in anything all those years is it too ambitious to hope im sentimentally sorry despite a genuine fear of sentimentality and pseudo unhappiness struggling under the weight of an a poster on complex trauma and a pair of sennheiser headphones to lock me in think of what it is when god himself puts his arms around you and says welcome home theres nothing mysterious about my thoughts or affect nor yours nor anyones biologically generated by the relationships we hide our consciousness from oh unhappiness and in delity disguised in metaphor youre nothing but the deep yearning of an infant for its mother and the furiousness making this connection is like remembering being born which is like folding time which is no one to blame and all the world to blame thank you for picking up the handless footless doll in the park saving him from a dog or fox or thoughtless children keeping him to your breast on the tram the bus in pubs and not noticing the scathing looks i learnt to trust without you leaving my thoughts outside for ve minutes and trusting the neighbors cat not to urinate on them im sorry my stand in mother was an evil replica machine like yet unpredictable we tried to calculate an algorithm for her mood as you wouldve done and in years never cracked it she remained seated when i left for the last time you werent to know and they wouldnt have believed you anyway we learn to accept the clouds for what they areand wait patiently instead of a cup of tea instead of a milk silk whelk of a cup of a cup of nearly six oclock teatime cup of a stumbling block cup of an afternoon unredeemed by talk cup of a cut brown loaf of a slice a lack of butter blueberry jam thats almost black instead of tannin seeping into the cracks of a pot the void of an hour seeps out infects the slit of a cut i havent the wit to fix with a surgeons needle threaded with fine gauge silk as a key would thread the cylinder of a lock but no key threads the cylinder of a lock late afternoon light transitory licks the place of the absent cup with its rough tongue flicks itself out beneath the wheels revolving spoke taut thoughts gone with a blink of attention slack a vision of death and distance in the mix she lost her words and how did she get them back when the corridor of a day was a lurching deck the dream life logic encodes in nervous tics she translated to a syntax which connects intense and unfashionable politics with morning coffee hudson sunsets sex then the short circuit of the final stroke the end toward which all lines looped out then broke what a gaze out the window interjects on the southeast corner a black lab balks tugged as the light clicks green toward a late day walk by a plump brown girl in a purple anorak the bronx bound local comes rumbling up the tracks out of the tunnel over west harlem blocks whose windows gleam on the animal warmth of bricks rouged by the fluvial light of six oclock am i lovely of course breathlessly i tastethe subtle compliment of a handmade caress chop me into tiny bits caress and tame my soul that godly swallowyou love to no end a gardenlate spring honeysuckle and lazy birdsheavy with the round scentof tuberoses and jungle gardenia there is a manin boots that make his thighslook lethal with a whipno spursmedieval sorrow in his eyesor around the mouth maybe he is dangerousin this place he hasthe fertility of steel there is a woman in a vine green habit her veins are purple her blue eyes she is blonde though sometimes brunette my horse is lamed i was riding i and still in the heavy air they push each other down like dogs with fleas under the bushes in them the camera pans to the nearest tree the cat approaches like a panther she is also in boots like an empresswho loves horses the man puts on spurs there is combat his knightly despair her deathly power the witch burns finally the lamed horse returns love you lanita we were not green in judgment or coldin blood like cleopatra in her youthwho still was ordering chopped radishin her bowls back then the hearts all gone to piecesnext to the winter greensthat in our days we never had use forso smitten were we with fireand ovens that i was gravy in judgment which might not mean muchunless youve taken a spoonof it and poured it back over a dumplingshaped like your heartso that it became even softer something you could not have thought possible its all happening now you liked to say and i agreed though it was not the newsfrom the outside i relished but the daily extra extra the lightof the morning brought to my attentionevery time we woke in your houseor my house and my heart salty risen was warmagain in a way it hadnt been for years organ of passion organ of righteousnessthat has never had a single flavor cross its lips how could you knowhow much i would miss the honey of those days her drizzle of it on the turkey bacon my cracking pepper up and down the pan the sweet meat of happiness i would no longer let pass between our teeth that dusty bubble gum once ubiquitous as starlings is no more my love whistling dinosaurs now populate only animation studios the furious actions of angels causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth and the bus stations old urinals go under the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers graduate into the wrinkle causing sun the sea seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one long goodbye perpetually the tide recedes beaches dotted with debris unto each is given a finite number of addresses ditties to dart the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon the swords hilt glints the daffodils bow down all is temporary as a perfect haircut a kitten in the lap yet sitting here with you my darling waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw seems all eternity ill ever need and all eternity needs of me it seems to have traveled at night supremely ironic lighting fires laying golden eggs in the midst of squalor its outer garments in the latest version sumptuous its linens more than shoddy drunk moreover at a seedy party the discriminating shunned and later bawdy in a run down neighborhood with whores and sailors chosen as companions while the queen went needy now that everything about it is known why does it come up purple or threadbare thrashing all its sunsets in a fit of pique or stripped in the seamiest hayloft ready to repeat dull anecdotes the millionth time its poise unquestionable its voice unsteady it is brilliant androgynous and stultifying with its threats and tears dissembling always its mad obsession with the blurred distinction and yet who else is so elementary and badly needed that fifty cultures rise at the merest rumor of its presence and finally punctually fall whenever it departs as if on schedule interviewed monday in the city dump which turned by magic into a hotel tower shedding poems and paintings for its bath it takes ten centuries of running water to wash it clean it then emerged all dirty again in a costume of ferocious splendor a hat some milliner in old vienna sweated over its pumps exchanged for sneakers and raced across the city breaking records just to prove its powers of endurance it lies down anywhere and loves the country but is so unassuming it can even flourish beneath electric signs and in railroad stations it goes to for the summer estivating it says near fountains that escape our notice and comes back in the fall its ribbons flying wheeling through the leaves singing all the voices of every opera in the repertoire plus one no one has ever dreamed of writing going about its gigantic business it masks itself as any shape or hope appearing as a vicious telephone call or a flat disturbing message in an envelope it praises calmness but adores upheaval is most to be desired when it apes composure and much to be distrusted when it boasts it has the only fingerprint that can be changed at will on paunchy green hills in some province of china you are the one i speak to someone buys a perfume recalling that the bones of his beloved are small when he writes the note when he wraps the little bottle he takes that into account so do i the subtlest trace of mind against your shoulders is your true skin and i press myself to you i hear the steady rhythm of your typing the key of a borrowed pulse but what difference does it make that it is given for a while it is mine to use then your turn but the pulse originates in the child of heaven who has hearts to spare some day youll sink yourself into a frozen lake where paper ships were torched with the names of the missing some dead some vanished the flames consume all but the wisp of smoke on which a single word rises and water licks at the rest so we are freed from a weight perennially your hills are filled with birds green hills the deep mosses around your temples they the birds are your faithful ones as i am naturally faithful to a world unknown a world for us alone paper thin and too fragile to speak of i cannot change as others do though you unjustly scorn since that poor swain that sighs for you for you alone was born no phyllis no your heart to move a surer way ill try and to revenge my slighted love will still love on will still love on and die when killd with grief amyntas lies and you to mind shall call the sighs that now unpitied rise the tears that vainly fall that welcome hour that ends this smart will then begin your pain for such a faithful tender heart can never break can never break in vain the gregarious dark is shifting when she puts her second drink the free one half on the coaster the tipped wine poised at the brim is the beginning of the bad girl shell promise never to be again tomorrow who can taunt him now to prove he doesnt love her and never could her hand slides up his thigh until he tenses my little prig dont you want to fuck me the bad girl she couldnt be at home his wife on ice all he can do is smile back as though shes made a harmless good natured joke and struggle not to look around to see whos heard whos watching he wants to smash the wine glass in her face so he can know for once exactly what hes done wrong but he places it instead back safely on the coaster quickly before she sees never cautious enough he is prepared even if she knocks it over to go down on his hands and knees and wipe it up kind and forgiving in all ways careful to acquit himself so that tomorrow when she says she doesnt deserve him hes too good he can believe her tomorrow will be his happy hour there wont be anything she wouldnt do for him so sexy to slide under neath a river to sit inside this snakelike sub marine like subway car and freely imagine the world above the brooklyn bridge invisibly trembling with the weight of its own beauty the east river still guided by the grooves walt whitmans eyes wore in it the bulldog tug boats pushing the passively impressive broad bottomed barges around and the double decker orange and black staten island ferries with their aura of overworked pack mule mournfulness and beyond them the atlantic ocean which i lately learned was brought here by ice comets three billion years ago which explains a few things like why everybody feels so alienated and of course the thoughts being thought by every person in new york city at this moment vast schools of undulating fish curving and rising in the cloud swirling wind waved sky surrounded by the vaster emptiness of non thought which holds them and which they try not to think about and you lying in bed in your sixth floor walk up sublet on st marks place such a breath taking ascension imagining me rising now to meet you thin are the night skirts left behind by daybreak hours that onward creep and thin alas the shred of sleep that wavers with the spirits wind but in half dreams that shift and roll and still remember and forget my soul this hour has drawn your soul a little nearer yet our lives most dear are never near our thoughts are never far apart though all that draws us heart to heart seems fainter now and now more clear to night love claims his full control and with desire and with regret my soul this hour has drawn your soul a little nearer yet is there a home where heavy earth melts to bright air that breathes no pain where water leaves no thirst again and springing fire is loves new birth if faith long bound to one true goal may there at length its hope beget my soul that hour shall draw your soul for ever nearer yet like silent naked monks huddledaround an old tree stump havingspun themselves in the nightout of thought and nothingness and god so pleased with their silencehe grants them teeth and tongues like us how long have you been gone a childs hot tears on my bare arms but lake winds pick him up blow him into the clouds i married a dreamer i wait he stops to listen to the early lilac orchestra he starts to change into blowy horizontal lake rain then migrating red admirals i thinksay remember i remember us we chose the imaginal north south somewhere between bartlett avenue and jupiter between lake michigan and the aegean remember we drink serbian cosmos together we eat squash blossoms and red snapper soup we visit the calatrava before bed we nurture a magnetic field of words i am remembering you back remembering plays time thinking is all remembering i remember our young bodies im not finished with us remember that if someone asks why is that lady out walking in that lake storm tell them months ago her husband went to the store in a blizzard never came back tell them she cant stop looking for him i lift lift you five states away your glass wide of this bar you never graced where none ever i know came where what work is done even by these men i know not where a brass police car sign peers in wet strange cars pass soiled hangs the rag of day out over this town a juke box brains air where i drink alone the spruce barkeep sports a toupee alas my glass i lift at six oclock my darling as you plotted chinese couples shift in bed we shared today not even filthy weather beasts in the hills their tigerish love are snarling suddenly they clash i blow my short ash red grey eyes light and we have our drink together begins in interruption an ambulance bell at the center of sleep the room tilts sideways furniture slides an octet of amber blueverres liqueur one with a cut at the lip clatters as a quaalude light in tatters mattes the curtains ormolu i miss you is what i want to say like a rocket stocked from the reagan years its radar gone haywire wiring fried but live inside a bunker of some private soviet union you i you rose from our embrace and the small light spread like an aureole around you the long parabola of neck and shoulder flank and thigh i saw permute itself through unfolding and unlimited minuteness in the movement of your tall tread the spine root swaying the picasso like clat of scissoring slender legs i knew some law of being was at work at one time i had said that love bestows such values and so it does but the old man in his canto was right and wise ubi amor ibi ocullus est always i wanted to give and in wanting was the poet a man now aging i know the best of love is not to bestow but to recognize what needeth these threnning words and wasted wind all this cannot make me restore my prey to rob your good iwis is not my mind nor causeless your fair hand did i display let love be judge or else whom next we meetthat may both hear what you and i can say she took from me an heart and i a glove from her let us see now if thone be worth thother now that i have your face by heart i look less at its features than its darkening frame where quince and melon yellow as young flame lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherds crook beyond a garden there in insolent ease the lead and marble figures watch the show of yet another summer loath to go although the scythes hang in the apple trees now that i have your face by heart i look now that i have your voice by heart i read in the black chords upon a dulling page music that is not meant for musics cage whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed the staves are shuttled over with a stark unprinted silence in a double dream i must spell out the storm the running stream the beats too swift the notes shift in the dark now that i have your voice by heart i read now that i have your heart by heart i see the wharves with their great ships and architraves the rigging and the cargo and the slaves on a strange beach under a broken sky o not departure but a voyage done the bales stand on the stone the anchor weeps its red rust downward and the long vine creeps beside the salt herb in the lengthening sun now that i have your heart by heart i see i am trying to remember the lyrics of old songs ive forgotten mostly i am trying to remember one hit wonders hymns and musicals like west side story singing over and over what i can recall i hum remnants on buses and in the car i am so often alone these days with echoes of these old songs and my ghosted lovers i am so often alone that i can almost hear it can almost feel the half touch of others can almost taste the licked clean spine of the melody ive lost i remember the records rubbed with static and the needle gathering dust i remember the taste of a mouth so sudden and still cold from wintry gusts it seemed incredible then a favorite song a love found it wasnt after all days later while vacuuming the lyrics come without thinking days later i think i see my old lover in a caf but dont how pleasing it was to think it was him to finally sing that song this is the way of all amplitude we need the brightness to die some this is the way of love and music it plays like a god and then is done do i feel better remembering knowing for certain whats gone how long will the bed that we made together hold us there your stubbled cheeks grazed my skin from evening to dawn a cloud of scattered particles now islands of shaving foam slowly spiraling down the drain blood drops stippling the water pink as i kiss the back of your neck our faces framed inside a medicine cabinet mirror the blade of your hand carves a portal out of steam the two of us like boys behind frosted glass who wave goodbye while a car shoves off into winter all that went unnoticed till now empty cups of coffee stacked up in the sink the neighborhood kids up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves how months on a kitchen calendar drop like frozen flies the flu season at its peak followed by a train of magic markered xxx s nights we d spend apart death must work that way a string of long distance calls that only gets through to the sound of your voice on our machine my heart s mute confession screened out how long before we turn away from flowers altogether your blind hand reaching past our bedridden shoulders to hit that digital alarm at delayed intervals till you shut it off completely alas madam for stealing of a kiss have i so much your mind there offended have i then done so grievously amiss that by no means it may be amended then revenge you and the next way is this another kiss shall have my life ended for to my mouth the first my heart did suck the next shall clean out of my breast it pluck what if we got outside ourselves and there really was an outside out there not just our insides turned inside out what if there really were a you beyond me not just the waves off my own fire like those waves off the backyard grill you can see the next yard through though not well just enough to know that off to the right belongs to someone else not you what if when we said i love you there were a you to love as there is a yard beyond to walk past the grill and get to to endure the endless walk through the self knowing through a bond that has no basis for ourselves are all we know is altruism not giving but coming to know someone is there through the wavy vision of the selfs heat love become a decision if it had become a competition in which we like children desperate for the blue ribbon pulled knotted hemp gripping until certain of calluses if our contest awarded the strongest the boy who could best inflict pain yet not flinch when injured then you won for i must imagine the brown of your back to reach my peak a short thread of breaths a tug of warwith the heaviest child grunting at the end of the rope until jerked and dragged over the line that fat kid flounders through muckthe way i splash your relentless name in shivers about me watch him wallow if he tastes mud as bitter as this poemof mine then i win and you love me a blind girl steps over the red staves of a tub steam rising from her shoulders and hair she walks across a dirt floor to you i think you are not her grandfather you watch with her a pink man who has avoided taxes for two winters he is being judged by roosters and has been chased this far into the countryside above him burning sacks of bat dung are arranged in the purple branches of the thistle trees the river is indifferent to him and so are we you tell your mistress the burning bags of shit are like inert buddhas dissolving in a field of merit she giggles a front tooth is loose with the river bottom clear as the night air the bargeman sings through the hungry vapors rising now like white snakes behind him you told his wife that lord buddha made wasps from yellow stalks of tobacco with a dark spit down in the cold bamboo a starving woman has opened a small pig the old moons climb from its blue glistening stomach or is it light from the infinitely receding sacks of shit master where is the difference our matchbox bedroom in the loft above your sculpture factory turns magical at times behind its dark blue druid door last night inside you sweetheart it felt as if i were coming from the soul itself and that indian summer sunday afternoon a year ago when the bed became a meadow of purple thistles the honey hidden at the bottom of the stem farm kids know to find for the sweetest suck of all and sometimes in the winter when the room turns into a cornell box filled with the everyday miracles soap bubble pipe and thimble wooden rabbits and old tan magazine illustrations of the zodiac or turns into an igloo in which the only place to go is to burrow here below the yellow blanket and the pillows to the south pacific of ourselves and then those mornings on vacation gentle as the feathers of a light spring rain and at the same time hard like the beak of a hawk you are where i belong my head my heart mine eyes my life nay more my joy my magazine of earthly store if two be one as surely thou and i how stayest thou there whilst i at ipswich lye so many steps head from the heart to sever if but a neck soon should we be together i like the earth this season mourn in black my sun is gone so far ins zodiack whom whilst i joyd nor storms nor frosts i felt his warmth such frigid colds did cause to melt my chilled limbs now nummed lye forlorn return return sweet sol from capricorn in this dead time alas what can i more then view those fruits which through thy heat i bore which sweet contentment yield me for a space true living pictures of their fathers face o strange effect now thou art southward gone i weary grow the tedious day so long but when thou northward to me shalt return i wish my sun may never set but burn within the cancer of my glowing breast the welcome house of him my dearest guest where ever ever stay and go not thence till natures sad decree shall call thee hence flesh of thy flesh bone of thy bone i here thou there yet both but one half awake i was imagining a friends young lover her ash blonde hair the smooth taut skin of twenty i imagined her short legs and dimpled knees the door scraped open but eyes closed i saw nothing the mattress sagged she laid her head on my chest and murmured love against my throat almost humming approaching song so palpable i could hold her only chastely if this was chaste i couldnt move my hand even to caress her freckled shoulder so this is how imagination works i thought sadly and when at last she spoke she spoke with the amused voice of my wife my wife who was at work but also here pleased at the confusion she was causing this is a lesson about flesh isnt it i asked blowfly she whispered on my throat as we made tense pensive love blowfly blowfly you you at the door a crumpled thing when i open surprised sing you hiss prosecute sentence waving your thin not arms like dollar bills your bewildering moldy skin one or two of you are you are you a god now bony wing beaten down smaller than ever not dead as you should be but not alive either as you indicate mumbling almost falling in on your clawed feet i still have desire you float at my small door me inside me inside life are you newborn now i ask are you remnant why why are there moneylenders you say swatting me away when i ask can i help growing more crumbled but more than just cloth all feather burlap beak fingergrip all edge and cling a thing not formed or not divided yet pre conception just at the threshold almost falling in your uneven crouching your chest a pulsation a languishment that will not die what is die now there is not blood on the earth anymore we disappear we pixilate races or places is it which remember what it was to carry your load your you that weight wondrous it was at intervals light struck silence and then the cutting of water sleeping audible thrown about by breath keeping a sharp lookout heres where free choice vanished here rights here the real meaning of the word you choose consequence capital commodity con sumption community come here says time just try to find it the here such a good game to keep you occupied for now the rest of the now its going to be a long time why are you here what are they lending you how can it be loaned what is a loan the changers who gets to keep it no one gets to keep it no one none of it what is it the money changers what can you change it into what else do you want the things to become but it wont stay still as currency either it will be changed again shape shifting and all the other tiny adjustments currency manipulation feel it all those other hands on it each with its own need having held it grasped changed folded tucked handed oh look it becomes virtual the fingerprint is lifted off its little stain no ones need is on it any more its clean it has never been and never again will be touched the looping ledger of the fingerprints wish i signed my name to this did you in the hush at the center among the closed shutters at the height of the day i signed i clenched the pen and then my dream it flowed no one is ever at home i dont know why had been told to live by any means possible did beyond the sea you could feel this period coming to an end all of it a bomb went off legs went off means went off blew off like gossamer nothing stalled you couldnt get it to stall seemed painted on but it was not was sleeping reality finally was sleeping so deeply you couldnt wake it up again you couldnt wake yourself again it rained time sputtered now and then like a regurgitation of space its a jail light says but it looks like just being lost full of the things we needed to learn us ready to step up and offer our lungs intake and out change me we say we want to be identified written in collected worth me up give me my true value but still i have to bring this to you in these words cracked glaze all over it little holes over it belief drilled through self that boutique gone under such dark windows history arrested history arrested how is that possible it flowed it flowed without us us on it if we could catch a ride sometimes how do you live in this end i look at you you have been through your war is done i try to squint it in do you really want to begin again is that why youre here i feel i could count your fingers each hair left on you each thread of skin each crease four or five times you cast a glance on us but then its done your passing by us now a buzzing of flies you stand at the window and the song begins we dont know what to do with it the moon that monster the fame and the thirst the night out there a shirt rolled up to reveal what dusk had hid a murky heart a love that would never be replaced but they are still there on the steps the money changers the steps of evening rise they want you to exchange that is the sacrament why does he keep throwing them out day after day forever listen to me you say you are going off into thought it is not a real road take yourself off the road he is and is not but he is and you are always in the holy place because just being in it makes it holy uphold it linger be eternal for this instant lodge in i cannot say in what have spent a lifetime saying in in flow in promise rich in haste experiment crowd season in bias gnawing at hope invisible in time standing in it confounded tongue in my mouth about to curl up speak promise taste promise laugh at the ignorance cherish ignorance dont leave this is where ive arrived dont slip away the reverse of the watching and waiting is finally here wasnt mine wasnt me speaking either not anymore this is that dream the darling of failure no identification all impending and then the now strikes it is unbreakable it is you must believe me i want to be here and also there where you receive this but i cant thats the whole story i will never know what is there to know you will not be changed you must believe when she came into his room he was asleep and when she touched him he woke her hand on his shoulder her knee at his mouth and in the darkness she looked like a boy when he tried to sit up she covered his ears with her hands save ourselves from ourselves she said and then a wind stirred in the room as if shed placed those words in his mouth seen my lady home las night jump back honey jump back hel huh han an squez it tight

cherrylog road i entered the ford without wheels smothered in kudzu with a seat pulled out to run corn whiskey down from the hills and then from the other side crept into an essex with a rumble seat of red leather and then out again aboard a blue chevrolet releasing the rust from its other color reared up on three building blocks none had the same body heat i changed with them inward toward the weedy heart of the junkyard for i knew that doris holbrook would escape from her father at noon and would come from the farm to seek parts owned by the sun among the abandoned chassis sitting in each in turn as i did leaning forward as in a wild stock car race in the parking lot of the dead time after time i climbed in and out the other side like an envoy or movie star met at the station by crickets a radiator cap raised its head become a real toad or a kingsnake as i neared the hub of the yard passing through many states many lives to reach some grandmothers long pierce arrow sending platters of blindness forth from its nickel hubcaps and spilling its tender upholstery on sleepy roaches the glass panel in between lady and colored driver not all the way broken out the back seat phone still on its hook i got in as though to exclaim let us go to the orphan asylum john i have some old toys for children who say their prayers i popped with sweat as i thought i heard doris holbrook scrape like a mouse in the southern state sun that was eating the paint in blisters from a hundred car tops and hoods she was tapping like code loosening the screws carrying off headlights sparkplugs bumpers cracked mirrors and gear knobs getting ready already to go back with something to show other than her lips new trembling i would hold to me soon soon where i sat in the ripped back seat talking over the interphone praying for doris holbrook to come from her fathers farm and to get back there with no trace of me on her face to be seen by her red haired father who would change in the squalling barn her backs pale skin with a strop then lay for me in a bootleggers roasting car with a string triggered i gauge shotgun to blast the breath from the air not cut by the jagged windshields through the acres of wrecks she came with a wrench in her hand through dust where the blacksnake dies of boredom and the beetle knows the compost has no more life someone outside would have seen the oldest cars door inexplicably close from within i held her and held her and held her convoyed at terrific speed by the stalled dreaming traffic around us so the blacksnake stiff with inaction curved back into life and hunted the mouse with deadly overexcitement the beetles reclaimed their field as we clung glued together with the hooks of the seat springs working through to catch us red handed amidst the gray breathless batting that burst from the seat at our backs we left by separate doors into the changed other bodies of cars she down cherrylog road and i to my motorcycle

loved save love and liberty i watched thee on the breakers when the rock received our prow and all was storm and fear and bade thee cling to me through every shock this arm would be thy bark or breast thy bier i watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground when overworn with watching neer to rise from thence if thou an early grave hadst found the

out trying to change or be changed regretting herself where do we meet each other w out trying to hang or be caged you elbow me with your corduroy jacket when a box chock full of antique marbles comes up i cant hear your whispers above the auctioneers racket the clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked me up when you impersonated him in bed like a wild thick mop i soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket in two days i will drive you to the airport packed with other couples pressed tightly at the top of the escalator lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket when we hug then a quick kiss good bye tacked on at the end ill finger the rim on the paper coffee cup you leave in my car when i hear your name i cant forget how your long torso pressed against my bare back bluish in this early light your fingers shot into me popped my spine into a wicked arch there is no lack of how it haunts me still what i bid lost sacked and wrapped for other girls i should have looked up to see who else was bidding but i studied the folds in your jacket my limit is spent loud and certain as the auctioneers racket if when studying road atlases while taking as you call it your morning dump you shout down to me names like miami city franconia canc n as places for you to take me to from here can i help it if all i can think is things that are stupid like he loves me he loves me not i dont think so no more than some mornings waking to your hands around me and remembering these are the fingers the hands ive over and over given myself to i can stop myself from wondering does that mean theyre the same ill grow old with yesterday in the caf i keep meaning to show you i thought this is how ill die maybe alone somewhere too far away from wherever you are then my heart racing from espresso and too many cigarettes my head down on the tables cool marble and the ceiling fan turning slowly above me like fortune the part of fortune thats half wished for only it did not seem the worst way i thought this is another of those things im always forgetting to tell you or dont choose to tell you or i tell you but only in the same way each morning i keep myself from saying too loud i love you until the moment you flush the toilet then i say it when the rumble of water running down through the house could mean anything flood your feet descending the stairs any moment any moment the whole world all i want of the world coming down i tell me it was for the hunger nothing less for hunger is to give the body what it knows it cannot keep that this amber light whittled down by another war is all that pins my hand to your chest i you drowningbetween my arms stay you pushing your body into the river only to be left with yourself stay i ill tell you how were wrong enough to be forgiven how one night after backhanding mother then taking a chainsaw to the kitchen table my father went to kneel in the bathroom until we heard his muffled cries through the walls and so i learned that a man in climax was the closest thing to surrender i say surrender say alabaster switchblade honeysuckle goldenrod say autumn say autumn despite the green in your eyes beauty despite daylight say youd kill for it unbreakable dawn mounting in your throat my thrashing beneath you like a sparrow stunned with falling i dusk a blade of honey between our shadows draining i i wanted to disappear so i opened the door to a strangers car he was divorced he was still alive he was sobbing into his hands hands that tasted like rust the pink breast cancer ribbon on his keychain swayed in the ignition dont we touch each other just to prove we are still here i was still here once the moon distant flickering trapped itself in beads of sweat on my neck i let the fog spill through the cracked window cover my fangs when i left the buick kept sitting there a dumb bull in pasture its eyes searing my shadow onto the side of suburban houses at home i threw myself on the bed like a torch watched the flames gnaw through my mothers house until the sky appeared bloodshot massive how i wanted to be that sky to hold every flying falling at once i say amen say amend say yes say yes anyway i in the shower sweating under cold water i scrubbed scrubbed i in the life before this one you could tell two people were in love because when they drove the pickup over the bridge their wings would grow back just in time some days i am still inside the pickup some days i keep waiting i its not too late our heads haloed with gnats summer too early to leave any marks your hand under my shirt as static intensifies on the radio your other hand pointing your daddys revolver to the sky stars falling one by one in the cross hairs this means i wont be afraid if were already here already more than skin can hold that a body beside a body must make a field full of ticking that your name is only the sound of clocks being set back another hour morning finds our clothes on your mothers front porch shed like week old lilies of loves discrete occasions we observe sufficient catalogue a likely sounding lexicon pronounced so as to implicate a wealth of difference where reclines instead a common element itself quite like those elements partaken at the table served by jesus on the night he was betrayed like those in that the bread was breakable the wine was red and wet and met the tongue with bright intoxicating sweetness quite like wine none of what i write arrives to compromise that sacrament the mystery of spirit graved in what is commonplace and plain the broken brittle crust the cup quite otherwise i choose instead to bear again the news that each each was still itself substantial in the simplest sense by now you will have learned of magdalen a name recalled for having won a touch of favor from the one we call the son of man and what youve heard is true enough i met him first as mute he scribbled in the dust to shame some village hypocrites toward leaving me unbloodied if ill disposed to taking up again a prior circumstance i met him in the house of one who was a pharisee and not prepared to suffer quietly my handling of the masters feet much later in the garden when having died and risen he spoke as to a maid and asked me why i wept when at any meeting with the christ was i not weeping for what i only speculate brief inability to speak a weak and giddy troubling near the throat a wash of gratitude and early on i think some slight abiding sense of shame a sop i have inferred more recently to do without lush poverty i think that this is what im called to say this mild exhortation that one should still abide all loves embarrassments and so resist the new temptation dangerous inexpedient mask of shame and well perhaps one other thing i have received some little bit about the glib divisions which so lately have occurred to you as right as necessary fit that the body is something less than honorable say in its appetites that the spirit is something pure and if all goes well potentially unencumbered by the bodys bawdy tastes this disposition then has led to a banal and pious lack of charity and worse has led more than a few to attempt some soul preserving severance harsh mortifications manglings all manner of ritual excision lately undertaken to prevent the bodys claim upon the heart or mind or blasphemy spirit whatever name you fix upon the suppos d bodiless i fear that you presume dissectingthe person unto something less complex i think that you forget you are not greek i think that you forget the very issue which induced the christ to take on flesh all loves are bodily require that the lips part and press their trace of secrecy upon the one beloved the one or many endless array whose aspects turn to face the one who calls the one whose choice it was one day to lift my own bruised body from the dust where it seems to me i must have met my death thereafter this subsequent life and late disinclination toward simple reductions in the name of jesus whose image i work daily to retain i have kissed his feet i have looked long into the trouble of his face and met in that intersection the sacred place where body and spirit both abide both yield in mutual obsession yes if youll recall your hebrew word just long enough to glimpse in its dense figure power to produce youll see as well the damage greek has wrought upon your tongue stolen from your sense of what is holy wholly good fully animal the body which he now prepares four white heifers with sprawling hooves trundle the waggon its ill roped crates heavy with fruit sway the chisel point of the goad blue and white glitters ahead a flame to follow lance high in a mans hand who does not shave his linen trousers like him want washing you can see his baked skin

boots rattling against the panels of an empty packsaddle do not answer strangers each with his train of seven or eight tied head to tail they pass silent but for the heavy bells and plip of slobber dripping from muzzle to dust save that on sand their soles squeak slightly milkmaids friendly girls between fourteen and twenty or younger bolt upright on small trotting donkeys that bray they arch their tails a few inches from the root stretch neck and jaw forward to make the windpipe a trumpet chatter jolted cans clatter the girls smiles repeat the black silk curve of the wimple under the chin their hats are absurd dolls hats or flat crowned to take a load all have fine eyes you can guess their balanced nakedness under the cotton gown and thin shift they sing and laugh they say adios shyly but look back more than once knowing our thoughts and sharing our desires and lack of faith in desire by the dry road the fathers cough and spit this is their room they are the ones who hung that bloody sun upon the southern wall and crushed the armored beetle to the floor the fathers skin is seamed and dry the map of that wild region where they drained the swamp and set provision out that they might sit of history the cracked precipitate until the glass be shattered and the sun descend to burn the prosperous flesh away of the filthy world so vilely fathered on the fathers such black cinders sitting there old pioneers what lecheries remain when schoolgirls pass what whispers of their skirts cold gleams of flesh solicit in your veined and gemlike eyes the custom of desire none now their eyes are sunk in ancient flesh and the sarcastic triumph of the mind they now enjoy letting their lust alone who may have kin but have no longer kind neither tomorrows monstrous tumor nor the reformation of the past they wish who hold in silent colloquy the world a shrivelled apple in the hand of god they hang at night their somber flags aloft and through the amorous dark pursue their theme of common images that sleep may show them done with all disasters but the one there are some things we just dont talk about not even in the morning when were waking when your calloused fingers tentatively walk the slope of my waist how loves a rust worn boat abandoned at the dock and who could doubt waves lick their teeth eyeing its hull were taking our wreckage as a promise so we dont talk we wet the tired oars tide drawing us out we understand theres nothing to be said both of us know the dangers of this sea warned by the tide worn driftwood of our pasts but weve already strayed from the harbor we thread a slow wake though the water then silently we start to row and will for as long as this lasts sunset backlights some pine to a caped sponge and though i throw my gasp after a monarch there is no hitch no hitching either to its serape or the echoing orange drawing a rope horizons doubledutch mina loy arthur cravan as blood hits the air goes red so i burst outside exhilarated he has thrown a tippet on the double bass which rests on its end pin the way a singer rests on a glittering stiletto while the other foot slips on a banan piano the strings are not the electrified wires of a prison camp but shes the instrument of his escape leaving me to educate my feelings subtracting the red from night til a winebottle dawns green leonora carrington max ernst i saw the chessplayers over their griddles all the furor of thinking swallowed like a song in a furred flute so it must seem when a small daughter disappears with a wife morning reabsorbed into a lambent priori jacqueline lamba andr the last light of a july evening drained into the streets below my love and i had hard things to say and hear and we sat over wine faltering picking our words carefully the afternoon before i had lain across my bed and my cat leapt up to lie alongside me purring and slowly growing dozy by this ritual i could clear some clutter from my baroque brain and into that brief vacancy the image of a horse cantered coming straight to me and i knew it brought hard talk and hurt and fear how did we do a medium job which is well above average but because she had opened her heart to me as far as she did i saw her fierce privacy like a gnarled luxuriant tree all hung with disappointments and i knew that to love her i must love the tree and the nothing it cares for me was he then adam of the burning way hid away in the heat like wrath conceald in loves face or the seed eris in eros key and lock of what i was i could not speak the releasing word for into a dark matter he came and askt me to say what i could not say i all the flame in me stopt against my tongue my heart was a stone a dumb unmanageable thing in me a darkness that stood athwart his need for the enlightening the i love you that has only this one quick in time this one start when its moment is true such is the sickness of many a good thing that now into my life from long ago this refusing to say i love you has bound the weeping the yielding the yearning to be taken again into a knot a waiting a string so taut it taunts the song it resists the touch it grows dark to draw down the lovers hand from its lightness to whats underground touching your goodness i am like a man who turns a letter over in his hand and you might think this was because the hand was unfamiliar but truth is the man has never had a letter from anyone and now he is both afraid of what it means and ashamed because he has no other means to find out what it says than to ask someone his uncle could have left the farm to him or his parents died before he sent them word or the dark girl changed and want him for beloved afraid and letter proud he keeps it with him what would you call his feeling for the words that keep him rich and orphaned and beloved alls over then does truth sound bitter as one at first believes hark tis the sparrows good night twitter about your cottage eaves and the leaf buds on the vine are woolly i noticed that today one day more bursts them open fully you know the red turns grey tomorrow we meet the same then dearest may i take your hand in mine mere friends are we well friends the merest keep much that i resign for each glance of the eye so bright and black though i keep with hearts endeavor your voice when you wish the snowdrops back though it stay in my soul for ever yet i will but say what mere friends say or only a thought stronger i will hold your hand but as long as all may or so very little longer i been candy since i came here young my born name keeps but i dont say to her who my mama was i was pure millstone cumbrance child aint but a towsack full of bane well i lit out right quick hitched and so forth legged it was rid accabee at first then thicket hid then wadmalaw out to nashs meat yard obies jook at county home they had this jazzhorn drumbeat orphan band them lambs they they let me bide and listen this gristly man he came he buttered me then took me off swore i was surely something let me ride in back some thing snared spat on thing being morelike moresoever what he meant no id never sound what brunts he called me what he done had i a hundred mouths how his mouth repeats on me down the years everlastingly riveled looking like rotfruit wasnt it runched up like a grub first chance i inched off back through bindweed i was gone nothing wrong with gone as a place for living whereby a spore eats air when she has to where ive fairly much clung for peace came the day i came here young i mothed my self i cleaved apart a soul can hide like moth on bark my born name keeps but i dont say now winter nights enlarge the number of their hours and clouds their storms discharge upon the airy towers let now the chimneys blaze and cups oerflow with wine let well turned words amaze with harmony divine now yellow waxen lights shall wait on honey love while youthful revels masques and courtly sights sleeps leaden spells remove this time doth well dispense with lovers long discourse much speech hath some defense though beauty no remorse all do not all things well some measures comely tread some knotted riddles tell some poems smoothly read the summer hath his joys and winter his delights though love and all his pleasures are but toys they shorten tedious nights im at a double wake in springfield for a childhood friend and his father who died years ago i join my aunt in the queue of mourners and walk into a brown study a sepia room with books and magazines the fathers in a coffin he looks exhumed the worse for wear but where my friends remains should be theres just the empty base of an urn where are his ashes his mother hands me a paper cup with pills leucovorin zovirax and azt henry wanted you to have these she sneers take all you want for all the good theyll do dlugos meester dlugos a lamp snaps on raquel not welch the chubby nurse is standing by my bed its a m time to flush the heplock and hook up the i v line false dawn is changing into day infusing the sky above the hudson with a flush of light my roommate stirs beyond the pinstriped curtain my first time here on g the aids ward the cheery d d building intentionality of the decor made me feel like jumping out a window id been lying on a gurney in an e r corridor for nineteen hours next to a psychotic druggie with a voice like abbie hoffmans he was tied up or down with strips of cloth hed tried to slug a nurse and sent up a grating adenoidal whine all night nurse nurse untie me please these rags have strange powers by the time they found a bed for me i was in no mood to appreciate the clever curtains in my room the same fabric exactly as the drapes and sheets of a p town guest house in which i once partied stayed all i can remember is the pattern nor did it help to have the biggest queen on the nursing staff clap his hands delightedly and welcome me to aids land i wanted to drop dead immediately that was the low point today these people are my friends in the process of restoring me to life a second time i can walk and talk and breathe simultaneously now i draw a breath and sing happy birthday to my roommate joe hes today i didnt think hed make it three weeks ago they told him that he had aplastic anemia and nothing could be done joe had been a rotten patient moaning operatically throwing chairs at nurses when he got the bad news there was a big change he called the relatives with whom he had been disaffected was anointed and communicated for the first time since the age of eight when he was raped by a priest and made a will as death drew nearer joe grew nicer almost serene then the anemia began to disappear not because of medicines but on its own ready to die it looks like joe has more of life to go hell go home soon when will you get out of here he asks me i dont know when the x ray shows no more pneumonia ive been here three weeks this time what have i accomplished read some balzac spent quality time with friends come back from deaths door and prayed prayed a lot barry bragg a former lover of a former lover and a new episcopalian has aids too and gave me a leatherbound and gold trimmed copy of the office the one with all the antiphons my list of daily intercessions is as long as a russian novel i pray about aids last last week i made a list of all my friends whove died or who are living and infected every day since ive remembered someone i forgot to list this morning it was chasen gaver the performance poet from dc i dont know if hes still around i liked him and could never stand his poetry which made it difficult to be a friend although i wanted to defend him one excruciating night at a folio reading where chasen snapped his fingers and danced around spouting frothy nonsense about andy warhol to the rolling eyes of self important language centered poets whose dismissive attitude and ugly manners were worse by far than anything that chasen ever wrote charles was his real name a classmate at antioch dubbed him chasen after the restaurant i guess once i start remembering so much comes back there are forty nine names on my list of the dead thirty two names of the sick cookie mueller changed lists saturday they all will i guess the living i mean unless i go before them in which case i may be on somebodys list myself its hard to imagine so many people i love dying but no harder than to comprehend so many already gone my beloved bobby maniac and boyfriend barry reminded me that he had sex with bobby on the coat pile at this christmas party two years in a row thats the way our life together used to be a lot of great adventures wholl remember bobbys stories about driving in his debutante dates fathers white mercedes from hole to hole of the golf course at the poshest country club in birmingham at a m or taking off his clothes in the redneck bar on a dare or working on stay hungry as the dresser of a then unknown named schwarzenegger who will be around to anthologize his purple cracker similes sweatin like a nigger on election day hotter than a half fucked fox in a forest fire the ones that i remember have to do with heat bobby shirtless sweating on the dance floor of the tiny bar in what is now a shelter for the indigent with aids on the dockstrip stripping shirts off chuck shaw barry bragg and me rolling up the tom rags using them as pom poms then bolting off down west street gracefully despite the overwhelming weight of his inebriation vaulting over trash cans as he sang i like to be in america in a puerto rican accent when i pass wholl remember who will care about these joys and wonders im haunted by that more than by the faces of the dead and dying a speaker crackles near my bed and nurses streak down the corridor the black guy on the respirator next door bought the farm maria tells me later but only when i ask she has tears in her eyes shed known him since his first day on g a long time ago will i also become a fond fondly regarded regular back for stays the way retired retiring widowers return to the hotel in nova scotia or provence where they vacationed with their wives i expect so although thats down the road todays enough to fill my plate a bell rings like the gong that marks the start of a fight its and dereks here to make the bed derek who at saw bob marleys funeral in the football stadium in kingston hot tears pouring down his face he sings as he folds linens you can fool some of the people some of the time dancing a little softshoe as he works theres a reason he came in just now divorce court drones on joes tv and derek is hooked i cant believe the script is plausible to him jamaican hipster that he is but he stands transfixed by the parade of faithless wives and screwed up husbands the judge is testy so am i unwilling auditor of drivel phone my friends to block it out david jane and eileen i missed the bash for davids magazine on monday and eileens reading last night jane says that marie christine flew off to marseilles where her mother has cancer of the brain reminding me that aids is just a tiny fragment of lifes pain eileen has been thinking about bobby too the dinner that we threw when he returned to new york after getting sick pencil thin disfigured by ks he held forth with as much kinetic charm as ever what we have to cherish is not only what we can recall of how things were before the plague but how we each responded once it started people have been great to me an avalanche of love has come my way since i got sick and not just moral support jaimes on the board of pens new fund for aids hes helping out don windham slipped a check inside a note and brad gooch got me something from the howard brookner fund whod have thought when we dressed up in ladies clothes for a night for a hoot in brad june buntt and howard lili la lean s suite at the chelsea that things would have turned out this way howard is dead at chris cox kay sera sera s friend bill gone too bernadette of lourdes guess who with aids god knows how many positive those th street wigs and enormous stingers and martinis dont provoke nostalgia for a time when love and death were less inextricably linked but for the stories we would tell the morning after best when they involved our friends second best our heroes j j mitchell was master of the genre when he learned he had aids i told him he should write them down his mind went first ill tell you one of his best j j was jerome robbins houseguest at bridgehampton every morning they would have a contest to see who could finish the times crossword first robbins always won until a day when he was clearly baffled grumbling scratching over letters he finally threw his pen down j j tell me what im doing wrong one clue was great th c choreographer the solution was massine but robbins had placed his own name in the space every word around it had been changed to try to make the puzzle work except that answer at this point thered be a horsey laugh from j j isnt that great hed say through clenched teeth locust valley lockjaw it was and there were lots more where that one came from only you cant get there anymore hes dropped into the maw waiting for the g denizens and for all flesh as silent as the hearts that beat upon the beds up here the heart of the drop dead beautiful east village kid who came in yesterday charles frosts heart nine inches from the spleen theyre taking out tomorrow the heart of the demented girl whose screams roll down the hallways late at night hearts that long for lovers for reprieve for old lives for another chance my heart so calm most days sinks like a brick to think of all that heartache ive been staying sane with program tools turning everything over to god as i understand him i dont understand him thank god i read so much calvin last spring the absolute necessity of blind obedience to a sometimes comforting sometimes repellent always incomprehensible source of light and life stayed with me god can seem so foreign a parent from another country like my dad and his own father speaking polish in the kitchen i wouldnt trust a father or a god too much like me though that is why i pack up all my cares and woes and load them on the conveyor belt the speed of which i cant control like chaplin on the assembly line in modern times or lucy on tv i dont need to run machines today im standing on a moving sidewalk headed for the dark or light whatevers there duncan hannah visits and we talk of out of body experiences his was amazing bingeing on vodka in his dorm at bard he woke to see a naked boy in fetal posture on the floor was it a corpse a classmate a pickup from the blackout of the previous night duncan didnt know he struggled out of bed walked over to the youth and touched his shoulder the boy turned it was duncan himself my own experience was milder dont make me flee screaming from the room as duncan did it happened on a tibetan meditation weekend at the cowley fathers house in cambridge michael koonsman led it healer whose enormous paws directed energy he touched my spine to straighten up my posture and i gasped at the rush we were chanting to tara goddess of compassion and peace in the basement chapel late at night i felt myself drawn upward not levitating physically but still somehow above my body a sense of bliss surrounded me it lasted ten or fifteen minutes when i came down my forehead hurt the spot where the third eye appears in buddhist art felt as though someone had pushed a pencil through it the soreness lasted for a week michael wasnt surprised he did a lot of work with people with aids in the epidemics early days but when he started losing weight and having trouble with a cough he was filled with denial by the time he checked into st lukes he was in dreadful shape the respirator down his throat squelched the contagious enthusiasm of his voice but he could still spell out what he wanted to say on a plastic ouija board beside his bed when the doctor who came in to tell him the results of his bronchoscopy said father im afraid i have bad news michael grabbed the board and spelled the truth is always good news after he died i had a dream in which i was a student in a class that he was posthumously teaching with mock annoyance he exclaimed oh tim i cant believe you really think that aids is a disease theres evidence in that direction ill tell him if the dream recurs the shiny hamburger in lucite look of the big lesion on my face the smaller ones i daub with makeup the loss of forty pounds in a year the fatigue that comes on at the least convenient times the symptoms float like algae on the surface of the grace that buoys me up today arthur comes in with the sacrament and we have to leave the room joes italian family has arrived for birthday cheer to find some quiet walk out to the breezeway where it might as well be august for the stifling heat on amsterdam pedestrians and drivers are oblivious to our small aerie as we peer through the grille like cloistered nuns since leaving g the first time i always slow my car down on this block and stare up at this window to the unit where my life was saved its strange how quickly hospitals feel foreign when you leave and how normal their conventions seem as soon as you check in from below its like checking out the windows of the west street jail hard to imagine what goes on there even if you know firsthand the sun is going down as i receive communion i wish the rites familiar magic didnt dull my gratitude for this enormous gift i wish i had a closer personal relationship with christ which i know sounds corny and alarming janet campbell gave me a remarkable ikon the last time i was here christ is in a chair a throne and st john the divine an androgyne who looks a bit like janet rests his head upon the saviors shoulder james madden priest of cowley dead of cancer earlier this year at gave her the image telling her not to be afraid to imitate st john there may come a time when im unable to respond with words or works or gratitude to aids a time when my attitude caves in when im as weak as the men who lie across the dayroom couches hour after hour watching sitcoms drawing blanks maybe my head will be shaved and scarred from surgery maybe ill be pencil thin and paler than a ghost pale as the vesper light outside my window now it would be good to know that i could close my eyes and lean my head back on his shoulder then as natural and trusting as id be with a cherished love at this moment chris walks in christopher earl wiss of kansas city and new york my lover my last lover my first healthy and enduring relationship in sobriety the man with whom i choose to share what i have left of life and time this is the hardest and happiest moment of the day g is no place to affirm a relationship two hours in a chair beside my bed after eight hours of work night after night for weeks its been a long haul and chris gets tired last week he exploded i hate this i hate your being sick and having aids and lying in a hospital where i can only see you with a visitors pass i hate that this is going to get worse i hate it too we kiss embrace and chris climbs into bed beside me to air mattress squeaks hold on we hold on to each other to a hope of how well be when i get out let him hold on please dont let him lose his willingness to stick with me to make love and to make love work to extend the happiness weve shared please dont let aids make me a monster or a burden is my prayer too soon chris has to leave i walk him to the elevator bank then totter back so raquel can open my i v again its not even mid evening but im nodding off my lifes so full even especially when im here on g when its time to move on to the next step that will be a great adventure too helena hughes tibetan buddhist tells me that there are three stages in death the first is white like passing through a thick but porous wall the second stage is red the third is black and then youre finished ready for the next event im glad she has a road map but i dont feel the need for one myself ive trust enough in all thats happened in my life the unexpected love and gentleness that rushes in to fill the arid spaces in my heart the way the city glow fills up the sky above the river making it seem less than night when joe ohare flew in last week he asked what were the best times of my new york years i said today and meant it i hope that death will lift me by the hair like an angel in a hebrew myth snatch me with the strength of sleeps embrace and gently set me down where im supposed to be in just the right place ae fond kiss and then we sever ae fareweel and then forever deep in heart wrung tears ill pledge thee warring sighs and groans ill wage thee who shall say that fortune grieves him while the star of hope she leaves him me nae cheerfu twinkle lights me dark despair around benights me ill neer blame my partial fancy naething could resist my nancy but to see her was to love her love but her and love forever had we never lovd sae kindly had we never lovd sae blindly never met or never parted we had neer been broken hearted fare thee weel thou first and fairest fare thee weel thou best and dearest thine be ilka joy and treasure peace enjoyment love and pleasure ae fond kiss and then we sever ae fareweel alas forever deep in heart wrung tears ill pledge thee warring sighs and groans ill wage thee i o what a physical effect it has on me to dive forever into the light blue sea of your acquaintance ah but dearest friends like forms are finished as life has ends still it is beautiful when october is over and february is over to sit in the starch of my shirt and to dream of your sweet ways as if the world were a taxi you enter it then reply to no one lets go five or six blocks isnt the blue stream that runs past you a translation from the russian arent my eyes bigger than love isnt this history and arent we a couple of ruins is carthage pompeii is the pillow the bed is the sun what glues our heads together o midnight o midnight is love what we are or has happiness come to me in a private car thats so very small im amazed to see it there we walk through the park in the sun and you say theres a spider of shadow touching the bench when mornings begun i love you i love you fame i love you raining sun i love you cigarettes i love you love i love you daggers i love smiles daggers and symbolism inside the symposium of your sweetest looks sunflower awning by the nurse faced chrysanthemums childhood again represents a summer spent sticking knives into porcelain raspberries when chinas still a country oh king edward abdicated years later thats exactly when if you were seventy thousand years old and i were a pill i know i could cure your headache like playing baseball in drinking water as baskets of towels sweetly touch the bathroom floor o benches of nothing appear and reappear electricity id love to be how you are as if the world were new and the selves were blue which we don until its dawn until evening puts on the gray hooded selves and the light brown selves of water your tear colored nail polish kisses me and the lumberyard seems new as a calm on the sea where like pigeons i feel so mutated sad so breezed so revivified and still so unabdicated not like an edge of land coming over the sea it doesnt take the full wind sickness just the mere the constant threat of it just the salt trace its faint knocking to bring the spirits of chance and chaos into this house they stand in doorways quaint foul allies swivelling their ghost hips tugging at their gowns of transparency and mischief they buzz me with lust and im undone remember these the cupid who ducked up from behind a wall and aimed an arrow one evening on broughton street whatever grabbed my shoulder at earlshall a sound of heavy boxes pushed up and down the empty hallway the past is the selfs ghoul what is it roddy you know youve blocked out what left your brain so empty that it gushed full with circus music and the safe bet of trivia here i am swinging on the fence of fences in limbo where the other world loves to try my pragmatism and its i who have invited them summoned by this self indulgent ouija but what is it that folds my clothes as i sleep and leaves them on the edge of the bed who hides my slippers re hangs the paintings deja vu did a minor goddess filch me in manila and follow me home prone as they are to easy led mortal men and im easy easy so come now teach me to believe in the soul hurt me with the truth press me back down on this cheap wine coloured carpet let me know for once and for all how fucked i am flour on the floor makes my sandals slip and i tumble into your arms too hot to bake this morning but blueberries begged me to fold them into moist muffins sticks of rhubarb plotted a whole pie the windows are blown open and a thickfruit tang sneaks through the wire screen and into the home of the scowly lady who lives next door yesterday a man in the city was rescued from his apartment which was filled with a thousand rats something about being angry because his pet python refused to eat he let the bloom of fur rise rise over the little gnarly blue rug over the coffee table the kitchen countertops and pip through each cabinet snip at the stumpy bags of sugar the cylinders of salt our kitchen is a riot of pots wooden spoons melted butter so be it maybe all this baking will quiet the angry voices next door if only for a brief whiff i want our summers to always be like this a kitchen wrecked with love a table overflowing with baked goods warming the already warm air after all the pots are stacked the goodies cooled and all the counters wiped clean let us never be rescued from this mess my bowl brimming with pretzels the snack you wanted least i slid open the door of our sleeping car where we had been enjoying the country rushing by as if we were the first two people to look down into the valleys and see bright necks of pines stretch across farms and streams to the groves they once cradled you had asked for earl grey cookies sandwiched around buttercream or marshmallows made of chocolate but all the tea bags had been dunked and the chocolate melted over biscotti when i came bearing the salted and twisted news the room was empty but for a heel it was black as a bunting and wound with zippers and every time the car rocked it looked ready to fly and escape into the cold tangled air of travel that always feels heavy with joy and desire and a little sadness always a little sadness because of the leaving which is what i do when i realize im in the wrong room and that numbers have betrayed me again while i was hunting and gathering foraging like homo habilis who probably never lost his cave out of patience i opened every door marked with threes and eights those conjoined twins disastrously separated at birth and roused the scabbed eyes of sleepers like a beggar no an angel a begging angel who has written on his heart will work for love having not found our room not heard the sharp swing of your voice i descended upon the passenger cars and row upon row of couples asleep or staring out the windows like zombies trying to remember what happens next once the newspaper is well thumbed the tea has gone cold and the conversation is dead i called for you in vain even using your secret names the ones only the night knows wind kiss brilliant fruit dervish moon over and over i said your names over and over until they filled the wounded air of the car and when there was no more room for another sound they caught and hooked the ring of the brakes hugging the rails just when i thought i wouldnt find you you were there the train was pulling away and i was watching you slowly eat a dish of whipped cream and bananas the house special in a cafe in a city we didnt know when you finished we started walking down a road that bent like a smile a shy smile like the one the japanese cat wore on your purse the road we were told would take us to the end of the line where all lovers in search of joy packed on bullet trains theyre the fastest on two continents arrive every hour when i come late to bed i move your leg flung over my side that warm gate nights youre not here i inch toward the middle of this boat balancing when i turn over in sleep you turn i turn you turn i turn you some nights you tug the edge of my pillow under your cheek look in my dream pulling the white sheet over your bare shoulder i marry you again as it would for a prow the basin parts with your foot never a marsh of heron blue but the single red feather from the wing of some black bird somewhere a planked path winds above water the line of sky above this aching space movement against the surface is the page that accepts no ink a line running even over the alternating depths organisms algae a rotting leaf walk naked before me carrying a sheaf of sticks its the most honest thing a man can do as water would to accept you i part a mouth a marsh or margin is of containment the inside circuitous edge no line to follow out to ocean no river against an envelope of trembling white ships here i am landlock give me your hand were lifted over the valley its steepling dustdevils the redwinged blackbirds convened vibrant arc their swift their dive against the filmy the finite air the profession of absence of being absented a lifting skyward then gone the moment of flight another resignation from the sweep of earth jackrabbit swallowtail harlequin duck believe in this refuge vivid tips of oleander white and red perimeters where no perimeter should be here is another in my long list of asides why have i never had a clock that actually gained time that apparatus which measures out the minutes is our own image forever losing and so the delicate unfixed condition of love the treacherous body the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged isnt one a suitable lens through which to see another filter the body filter the mind filter the resilient land and by resilient i mean which holds which tolerates the inconstant lover the pitiful treatment the experiment the untried untrue the last stab at wellness choose your own adventure drug failure or organ failure cataclysmic climate change or something akin to whats killing bees colony collapse more like us than wed allow this wondrous swatch of rough why do i need to say the toads and moor and clouds in a spring of misunderstanding i took the crickets sound and delight i took in the sex of every season the tumble on moss the loud company of musicians the shy young bookseller anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble to be picked from the crepuscule at the forests edge until the nocturnal animals crept forth their eyes like the lamps in store windows forgotten vaguely firing a desire for home hence the bodys burden its resolute campaign trudge on and if the war does not shake us from our quietude nothing will i carry the same baffled heart i have always carried a bit more battered than before a bit less joy for i see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere by the open air i swore out my list of pleasures sprig of lilac scent of pine the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch their song the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom and the cherry forms its first full buds the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth and youth passing into maturity ripening its flesh growing softer less unattainable ruddy and spotted plum daily i mistake there was a medication i forgot to take there was a man who gave himself decently to me i refused him in a protracted stillness i saw that heron i didnt wish to disturb was clearly a white sack caught in the redbuds limbs i did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until daylight dont leave me now i havent done with you nor that in this late hour we still cannot make peace if i inconsequential being that i am forsake all others how many others correspondingly forsake this world light light do not go i sing you this song and i will sing another as well when i was one and twenty i heard a wise man say give crowns and pounds and guineas but not your heart away give pearls away and rubies but keep your fancy free but i was one and twenty no use to talk to me when i was one and twenty i heard him say again the heart out of the bosom was never given in vain tis paid with sighs a plenty and sold for endless rue and i am two and twenty and oh tis true tis true alas so all things now do hold their peace heaven and earth disturb d in no thing the beasts the air the birds their song do cease the night s car the stars about doth bring calm is the sea the waves work less and less so am not i whom love alas doth wring bringing before my face the great increase of my desires whereat i weep and sing in joy and woe as in a doubtful case for my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring but by and by the cause of my disease gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting when that i think what grief it is again to live and lack the thing should rid my pain i can feel she has got out of bed that means it is seven a m i have been lying with eyes shut thinking or possibly dreaming of how she might look if at breakfast i spoke about the hidden place in her which to me is like a sopranos tremolo and right then over toast and bramble jelly if such things are possible she came i imagine she would show it while trying to conceal it i imagine her hair would fall about her face and she would become apparently downcast as she does at a concert when she is moved the hypnopompic play passes and i open my eyes and there she is next to the bed bending to a low drawer picking over various small smooth black white and pink items of underwear she bends so low her back runs parallel to the earth but there is no sway in it there is little burden the day has hardly begun the two mounds of muscles for walking leaping lovemaking lift toward the east what can i say simile is useless there is nothing like them on earth her breasts fall full the nipples are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron bars of the gate under the earth where those who could not love press wanting to be born again i reach out and take her wrist and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my pajamas later when i open my eyes there she is again rummaging in the same low drawer the clock shows eight hmmm with huge silent effort of great mounded muscles the earth has been turning she takes a piece of silken cloth from the drawer and stands up under the falls of hair her face has become quiet and downcast as if she will be all day among strangers looking down inside herself at our rapture custom whose laws we all allow and bow before his shrine has so ordained my friend that you are now my valentine ah could my humble muse aspire to catch the flame divine these are the gifts that id require for thee my valentine may virtue oer thy steps preside and in thy conduct shine may truth and wisdom ever guide and guard my valentine may piety seraphic maid her influence divine shed on thy head and ever lead and bless my valentine lifes dangerous paths safe mayst thou tread shielded by grace divine and when these artless lines are read think on my valentine stella think not that i by verse seek fame who seek who hope who love who live but thee thine eyes my pride thy lips my history if thou praise not all other praise is shame nor so ambitious am i as to frame a nest for my young praise in laurel tree in truth i sweare i wish not there should be graved in mine epitaph a poets name nay if i would could i just title make that any laud to me thereof should grow without my plumes from others wings i take for nothing from my wit or will doth flow since all my words thy beauty doth endite and love doth hold my hand and makes me write the sun met the moon at the corner noon in thin air commotion you later choose to notice love shapes the heart that once was pieces you take in hand the heart in mind your fates consistent alongside mine unless a mess your best guess that is right thanks the intimate fact that you elect it at corners dressed or naked with lips taste full body time thick or thin fixated love take heart as heart takes shape and recognition ceases to be obscure one line down the center another flying outward enters the unthinkable prospect of a world in which i am left to my own devices which are few and as soon as the batteries die useless first order of business i draw a map in the sand mark where i stand as the capital of civilization within me the detailed blueprints of the pyramids and the concept of zero beyond me the finite frontier the many miles of undeveloped shoreline with spectacular views of a sea filled with intricately depicted monsters i have a lot to do before i introduce the new world to art and astronomy and industry medicine and technology ethics politics democracy by a show of hands we shall elect which tree to burn in the first fire why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples why do you dim yourself with folded silks do you not see that i can buy brocades in any drapers shop and that i am choked in the twilight of all these colors how pale you would be and startling how quiet but your curves would spring upward like a clear jet of flung water you would quiver like a shot up spray of water you would waver and relapse and tremble and i too should tremble watching murex dyes and tinsel and yet i think i could bear your beauty unshaded i neer was struck before that hour with love so sudden and so sweet her face it bloomed like a sweet flower and stole my heart away complete my face turned pale as deadly pale my legs refused to walk away and when she looked what could i ail my life and all seemed turned to clay and then my blood rushed to my face and took my eyesight quite away the trees and bushes round the place seemed midnight at noonday i could not see a single thing words from my eyes did start they spoke as chords do from the string and blood burnt round my heart are flowers the winters choice is loves bed always snow she seemed to hear my silent voice not loves appeals to know i never saw so sweet a face as that i stood before my heart has left its dwelling place and can return no more on village green whose smooth and well worn sod cross pathed with many a gossips foot is trod by cottage door where playful children run and cats and curs sit basking in the sun where oer an earthen seat the thorn is bent cross armed and back to wall poor william leant his bonnet all awry his gathered brow his hanging lip and lengthened visage show a mind but ill at ease with motions strange his listless limbs their wayward postures change while many a crooked line and curious maze with clouted shoon he on the sand portrays at length the half chewed straw fell from his mouth and to himself low spoke the moody youth how simple is the lad and reft of skill who thinks with love to fix a womans will who every sunday morn to please her sight knots up his neckcloth gay and hosen white who for her pleasure keeps his pockets bare and half his wages spends on pedlars ware when every niggard clown or dotard old who hides in secret nooks his oft told gold whose field or orchard tempts with all her pride at little cost may win her for his bride while all the meed her silly lover gains is but the neighbours jeering for his pains on sunday last when susans banns were read and i astonished sat with hanging head cold grew my shrinking frame and loose my knee while every neighbours eye was fixed on me ah sue when last we worked at hodges hay and still at me you mocked in wanton play when last at fair well pleased by chapmans stand you took the new bought fairing from my hand when at old hobbs you sung that song so gay sweet william still the burthen of the lay i little thought alas the lots were cast that thou shouldst be anothers bride at last and had when last we tripped it on the green and laughed at stiff backed rob small thought i ween ere yet another scanty month was flown to see thee wedded to the hateful clown ay lucky churl more gold thy pockets line but did these shapely limbs resemble thine id stay at home and tend the household gear nor on the green with other lads appear ay lucky churl no store thy cottage lacks and round thy barn thick stand the sheltered stacks but did such features coarse my visage grace id never budge the bonnet from my face yet let it be it shall not break my ease he best deserves who doth the maiden please such silly cause no more shall give me pain nor ever maiden cross my rest again such grizzled suitors with their taste agree and the black fiend may take them all for me now through the village rose confused sounds hoarse lads and children shrill and yelping hounds straight every housewife at her door is seen and pausing hedgers on their mattocks lean at every narrow lane and alleys mouth loud laughing lasses stand and joking youth a bridal band tricked out in colours gay with minstrels blithe before to cheer the way from clouds of curling dust that onward fly in rural splendour break upon the eye as in their way they hold so gaily on caps beads and buttons glancing in the sun each village wag with eye of roguish cast some maiden jogs and vents the ready jest while village toasts the passing belles deride and sober matrons marvel at their pride but william head erect with settled brow in sullen silence viewed the passing show and oft he scratched his pate with careless grace and scorned to pull the bonnet oer his face but did with steady look unaltered wait till hindmost man had passed the churchyard gate then turned him to his cot with visage flat where honest lightfoot on the threshold sat up leaped the kindly beast his hand to lick and for his pains received an angry kick loud shuts the door with harsh and thundering din the echoes round their circling course begin from cot to cot church tower and rocky dell it grows amain with wide progressive swell and lightfoot joins the coil with long and piteous yell i am not saying mark my words as the thief says early each winter he leaves nothing of value he too wants a brute with language he has a fondnessfor preaching i am bathed to luster memories move musically through my bones he sings above vaults off a horse with feignedkindness lands so fancy letting go of this sitting with tropical leaves the size of menin a terrarium i am beautiful he means well admonishing women he is lucky with the show of crankiness what does it mean to let go the envy i sometimes hope stars dont spread themselvesover new yorks lights performing for himself glasses glittering he reads stories of poverty claims them all as his own here in colorado irises of all colors unfoldoutwards to the half hidden sun on the cracked cement chilly before rain i see perpetual beginnings im going to forget him lock him in a box in my head lock him in the haunt of violins let go whats his in the hurl of breath of my groans we watched her grow up she was the urgent chirper fledgling flier and when spring rolled out its green shed grown into the most noticeable bird girl long legged and just the right amount of blush tipping her wings crest and tail and she knew it in the bird parade we watched her strut she owned her stuff the males perked their armor greased their wings and flew sky loop missions to show off for her in the end there was only one isnt that how it is for all of us theres that one you circle back to for home this morning the young couple scavenges seeds on the patio she is thickening with eggs their minds are busy with sticks the perfect size tufts of fluff like dandelion and other pieces of soft he steps aside for her so she can eat then we watch him fill his beak walk tenderly to her and kiss her with seed the sacred world lifts up its head to notice we are double triple blessed two musics washing over me and morning asks which loneliness comes closest to the inky chromatics inside you how can i answer the cricket in the tarantulas cage chirrs the next world meanwhile scraps of chopin float up the stairs on my wifes trilling fingers which played me whole worlds ago last night when i was buried in we they are human after all you think as the waiter steps up to a tableout of sight of you reserved corner table they too are thin skinned and pleasure seeking with their own feelings and their own sufferings youre not so all alonein your mess your restlessness your shakes they too will be full of doubt dither shilly shallying even if its all about making deals the universal humanalbeit in its commercial manifestations but present there too truly the grief of hearts is ubiquitous and unending but whether they were ever in love outwith the awful wedded bed burning athirst desert parchedfor the nectar of a faraway mouth sinking drowningin the impossibility of a union of souls you wont know nor can youask the waiter whos just ringing upanother bock always avid for couponsto quench a thirst of another nature though also deep father gave her a little extra how could she not fall for him he was handsome but still a boy in the depot where soldiers took such women his skinny body clung too close to hers and his narrow ass still belonged to his mother the other men knew the routine and how much to pay she loathed their accent and american swagger the sweat would barely cool and dry before another shook the cot and bucked his hips out of rhythm in some other time zone however he began to offer other things besides money he brought sweets from the base and the minute he touched his pocket the face she reserved for his english crumbled like sweet toffee because he didnt know how to say what he wanted to say no time was spent on uneasiness chocolate caramel and peanuts spoke best secured his place he hooked his arms through hers as if they could stroll the lane like an ordinary couple the unassuming black and the korean whore in the middle of the vietnam war ah ah cries the crow arching toward the heavy sky over the marina lands on the crown of the palm tree ah ah slaps the urgent cove of ocean swimming through the slips we carry canoes to the edge of the salt ah ah groans the crew with the weight the winds cutting skin we claim our seats pelicans perch in the draft for fish ah ah beats our lungs and we are racing into the waves though there are worlds below us and above us we are straight ahead ah ah tattoos the engines of your plane against the sky away from these waters each paddle stroke follows the curve from reach to loss ah ah calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale yellow sail we fly by on our return over the net of eternity thrown out for stars ah ah scrapes the hull of my soul ah ah swear by the olive in the god kissed land there is no sugar in the promised land why must the bars turn neon now when love im already drunk in your capitalist land if home is found on both sides of the globe home is of course here and always a missed land the hours come to redeem the pledge not wholly in fates long years ago we made a tryst land clearly these men were here only to destroy a mosque now the dust of a prejudiced land will the doomsayers die bitten with envy when springtime returns to our dismissed land the prisons fill with

lie still the hairy and the white and soon down ladders of reflected light the sleepers climb in silence gradually they separate on paths of long ago each winding on his arm the unpleasant clew that leads live as a nerve to memory but often when too steep her dream descends perhaps to the grotto where her father bends to pick her up the husband wakes as though he had forgotten something in the house motionless he eyes the room that glows with the little animals of light that prowl this way and that soft are the beasts of light but softer still her hand that drifts so white upon the whiteness how like a water plant it floats upon the black canal of sleep suspended upward from the distant deep in pure achievement of its lovely want quietly then he plucks it and it folds and is again a hand small as a childs he would revive it but it barely stirs and so he carries it off a little way and breaks it open gently now he can see the sweetness of the fruit his hand eats hers i dawn is dim on the dark soft water soft and passionate dark and sweet loves own self was the deep seas daughter fair and flawless from face to feet hailed of all when the world was golden loved of lovers whose names beholden thrill mens eyes as with light of olden days more glad than their flight was fleet so they sang but for men that love her souls that hear not her word in vain earth beside her and heaven above her seem but shadows that wax and wane softer than sleeps are the seas caresses kinder than loves that betrays and blesses blither than springs when her flowerful tresses shake forth sunlight and shine with rain all the strength of the waves that perish swells beneath me and laughs and sighs sighs for love of the life they cherish laughs to know that it lives and dies dies for joy of its life and lives thrilled with joy that its brief death gives death whose laugh or whose breath forgives change that bids it subside and rise ii hard and heavy remote but nearing sunless hangs the severe skys weight cloud on cloud though the wind be veering heaped on high to the sundawns gate dawn and even and noon are one veiled with vapour and void of sun nought in sight or in fancied hearing now less mighty than time or fate the grey sky gleams and the grey seas glimmer pale and sweet as a dreams delight as a dreams where darkness and light seem dimmer touched by dawn or subdued by night the dark wind stern and sublime and sad swings the rollers to westward clad with lustrous shadow that lures the swimmer lures and lulls him with dreams of light light and sleep and delight and wonder change and rest and a charm of cloud fill the world of the skies whereunder heaves and quivers and pants aloud all the world of the waters hoary now but clothed with its own live glory that mates the lightning and mocks the thunder with light more living and word more proud iii far off westward whither sets the sounding strife strife more sweet than peace of shoreless waves whose glee scorns the shore and loves the wind that leaves them free strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as life shifts the moonlight coloured sunshine on the sea toward the sunsets goal the sunless waters crowd fast as autumn days toward winter yet it seems here that autumn wanes not here that woods and streams lose not heart and change not likeness chilled and bowed warped and wrinkled here the days are fair as dreams iv o russet robed november what ails thee so to smile chill august pale september endured a woful while and fell as falls an ember from forth a flameless pile but golden girt november bids all she looks on smile the lustrous foliage waning as wanes the morning moon here falling here refraining outbraves the pride of june with statelier semblance feigning no fear lest death be soon as though the woods thus waning should wax to meet the moon as though when fields lie stricken by grey decembers breath these lordlier growths that sicken and die for fear of death should feel the sense requicken that hears what springtide saith and thrills for love spring stricken and pierced with aprils breath the keen white winged north easter that stings and spurs thy sea doth yet but feed and feast her with glowing sense of glee calm chained her storm released her and storms glad voice was he south wester or north easter thy winds rejoice the sea v a dream a dream is it all the season the sky the water the wind the shore a day born dream of divine unreason a marvel moulded of sleep no more for the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving feel as in slumber beneath them heaving soothes the sense as to slumber leaving sense of nought that was known of yore a purer passion a lordlier leisure a peace more happy than lives on land fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure the dreaming head and the steering hand i lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow the deep soft swell of the full broad billow and close mine eyes for delight past measure and wish the wheel of the world would stand the wild winged hour that we fain would capture falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb so brief so soft and so full the rapture was felt that soothed me with sense of home to sleep to swim and to dream for ever such joy the vision of man saw never for here too soon will a dark day sever the sea birds wing from the sea waves foam a dream and more than a dream and dimmer at once and brighter than dreams that flee the moments joy of the seaward swimmer abides remembered as truth may be not all the joy and not all the glory must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary for there the downs and the sea banks glimmer and here to south of them swells the sea tonight i will remember the model with the wide sad mouth who used to pose for father because i love the dangers of memory the boarded window and door rooms where one bare bulb makes shadows swell up the wall and yet i recall only vaguely the way her hem rustled on the floor like sand against tin laisse moi tranquille epicier it said because i want it to say something memorable i want her back that brilliant farfetched woman who drank coffee in our garden and the days father fed me absinthe through a sugar cube so i would be asleep by noon and wake to find ramona posing naked with a tambourine tonight the whole world is a garden in which the immortal whispers something about art and its opportunities memory like a bolt of silk in a tailors arms can be made into anything especially misfortune especially the year ramona spent in a wrath almost biblical and so far from the world not even the moon could find her study in paris where the doors opened to the river i try to think of the cup of a hand of legs in a tangle and not the thistle though even it purpled spiking away wants to be admired wants to say whistle a little for me o every little thing wants to be loved wants to be marked by the cry that brings desire to it even blue eyed fly to the bloated hiss of death to love is to be remiss the horse alone in the wide flat field nods its head as if the bridle and bit were missed or mocked the cow slung with the unmilked weight of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder at o lonesome me i want to say to her need as if crooning could be enough sweet sweet mama truth be told the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds honey terrifies me when the stink of slurry season is over and the greened fields are slathered fecund overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit then i dream a little dream of you and me curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf wind driven and scudding along the lakes surface all night we glide to its blue harbor and back again the fattened slack of us singing o darlin darlin darlin everyone forgets that icarus also flew its the same when love comes to an end or the marriage fails and people say they knew it was a mistake that everybody said it would never work that she was old enough to know better but anything worth doing is worth doing badly like being there by that summer ocean on the other side of the island while love was fading out of her the stars burning so extravagantly those nights that anyone could tell you they would never last every morning she was asleep in my bed like a visitation the gentleness in her like antelope standing in the dawn mist each afternoon i watched her coming back through the hot stony field after swimming the sea light behind her and the huge sky on the other side of that listened to her while we ate lunch how can they say the marriage failed like the people who came back from provence when it was provence and said it was pretty but the food was greasy i believe icarus was not failing as he fell but just coming to the end of his triumph its how she spreads without a sound her scent of orange blossom on the dark of me it is the way she shrouds in mourning black her mother of pearl and ivory the way she wears the lace ruff at her throat and how she turns her face quite voiceless self possessed because she takes the language straight to heart is thrifty with the words she speaks its how she is so reticent yet welcoming when she comes out to face my panegyrics the way she says my name mocking and mimicking makes gentle fun yet shes aware that my unspoken drama is really of the heart though a little silly its how when night is deep and at its darkest we linger after dinner vaguely talking and her laughing smile grows fainter and then falls gently on the tablecloth its the teasing way she wont give me her arm and then allows deep feeling to come with us when we walk out promenading on the hot colonial boulevard because of this your sighing modest style of love i worship you my faithful star who like to cloud yourself about in mourning generous hidden blossom kindly mellowness who have presided over my thirty years with the self denying singleness a vase has whose half blown roses wreathe with scent the headboard of a convalescent man cautious nurse shy serving maid dear friend who trembles with the trembling of a child when you revise the reading that we share apprehensive always timid guest at the feast i give my ally humble dove that coos when it is morning in a minor key a key thats wholly yours may you be blessed modest magnificent you have possessed the highest summit of my heart you who are at once the artist of lowly and most lofty things who bear in your hands my life as if it was your work of art o star and orange blossom may you dwindle gently rocked in an unwedded peace and may you fade out like a morning star which the lightening greenness of a meadow darkens or like a flower that finds transfiguration on the blue west as it might on a simple bed adrift in the liberating late light of august delicate frivolous they make their way to my front porch and flutter near the glassed in bulb translucent as a thought suddenly wondered aloud illumining the air thats thick with honeysuckle and dusk you and i are doing our best at conversation keeping it light steering clear of what wed like to say you leave and the night becomes cluttered with moths some tattered their dumbly curious filaments startling against my cheek how quickly instinctively i brush them away dazed they cling to the outer darkness like pale reminders of ourselves others seem to want so desperately to get inside months later ill find the woolens snug in their resting places full of missing pieces one by one they appear in the darkness a few friends and a few with historical names how late they start to shine but before they fade they stand perfectly embodied all the past lapping them like a cloak of chaos they were men who i thought lived only to renew the wasteful force they spent with each hot convulsion they remind me distant now true they are not at rest yet but now that they are indeed apart winnowed from failures they withdraw to an orbit and turn with disinterested hard energy like the stars i cut myself upon the thought of youand yet i come back to it again and again a kind of fury makes me want to draw you outfrom the dimness of the presentand set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses then going obviously to inhale their fragrance i touch the blade of you and cling upon it and only when the blood runs out across my fingersam i at all satisfied how can i keep my maidenhead my maidenhead my maidenhead how can i keep my maidenhead among sae mony men o the captain bad a guinea fort a guinea fort a guinea fort the captain bad a guinea fort the colonel he bad ten o but ill do as my minnie did my minnie did my minnie did but ill do as my minnie did for siller ill hae nane o ill gie it to a bonie lad a bonie lad a bonie lad ill gie it to a bonie lad for just as gude again o an auld moulie maidenhead a maidenhead a maidenhead an auld moulie maidenhead the weary wark i ken o the stretchin ot the strivin ot the borin ot the rivin ot and ay the double drivin ot the farther ye gang ben o o happy dames that may embrace the fruit of your delight help to bewail the woeful case and eke the heavy plight of me that wonted to rejoice the fortune of my pleasant choice good ladies help to fill my mourning voice in ship freight with remembrance of thoughts and pleasures past he sails that hath in governance my life while it will last with scalding sighs for lack of gale furthering his hope that is his sail toward me the sweet port of his avail alas how oft in dreams i see those eyes that were my food which sometime so delighted me that yet they do me good wherewith i wake with his return whose absent flame did make me burn but when i find the lack lord how i mourn when other lovers in arms across rejoice their chief delight drowned in tears to mourn my loss i stand the bitter night in my window where i may see before the winds how the clouds flee lo what a mariner love hath made of me and in green waves when the salt flood doth rise by rage of wind a thousand fancies in that mood assail my restless mind alas now drencheth my sweet foe that with the spoil of my heart did go and left me but alas why did he so and when the seas wax calm again to chase fro me annoy my doubtful hope doth cause me pain so dread cuts off my joy thus is my wealth mingled with woe and of each thought a doubt doth grow now he comes will he come alas no no i swive as well as others do im young not yet deformed my tender heart sincere and true deserves not to be scorned why phyllis then why will you swive with forty lovers more can i said she with nature strive alas i am alas i am a whore were all my body larded oer with darts of love so thick that you might find in evry pore a well stuck standing prick whilst yet my eyes alone were free my heart would never doubt in amrous rage and ecstasy to wish those eyes to wish those eyes fucked out not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control supposd as forfeit to a confind doom the mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assurd and peace proclaims olives of endless age now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes and thou in this shalt find thy monument when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent toggle me up on one last vanity flight half drunk on a screw top frizzante it takes a hell of a lot more to get me here than it did when i had beauty boys when bedding me was the easy way to know me dont tuck me in so tight im not your grandma this rough blanket its green red yellow indigo stripes i traded for a perfectly warm beaver pelt fly me once more over my disloyal youth and its hangdog slavering over men whom age has de sexed right along with me they broadcast impotent outrage from aluminum tablets i collect speculums with bakelite handles arranging them by size though it no longer matters in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors note but tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view is pleased to dote nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted nor tender feeling to base touches prone nor taste nor smell desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be only my plague thus far i count my gain that she that makes me sin awards me pain the brown girl golden sable eyed flourishing yellow hibiscus steps exuberant august into august her lushly brocaded gold silk sari lavishing honey light at her auburn feet sandalled cedarly with scent of sandalwood haloing her her individualized warm light dark body her every glance a direction of the air her look of mischievous even tart sweetness o has she she has come in from mornings slight autumnal chill her feet moistened with diamantine dew how the sea summers in grass that same grass

grapes i love you replied the grapes thou art my lute by thee i sing my being is attuned to thee thou settest all my words a wing and meltest me to melody thou art my life by thee i live from thee proceed the joys i know sweetheart thy hand has power to give the meed of love the cup of woe thou art my love by thee i lead my soul the paths of light along from vale to vale from mead to mead and home it in the hills of song my song my soul my life my all why need i pray or make my plea since my petition cannot fall for im already one with thee an idle poet here and there looks round him but for all the rest the world unfathomably fair is duller than a witlings jest love wakes men once a lifetime each they lift their heavy lids and look and lo what one sweet page can teach they read with joy then shut the book and some give thanks and some blaspheme and most forget but either way that and the childs unheeded dream is all the light of all their day i spent a night turning in bed my love was a feather a flat sleeping thing she was very white and quiet and above us on the roof there was another woman i also loved had addressed myself to in a fit she returned that encompasses it but now i was lonely i yelled but what is that ugh she said beside me she put her hand on my back for which act i think to say this wrongly as we went walking far and widethrough silent fields and countryside we watched together star signs brimand rise above the oceans rim and planets too that fret with lightthe icy caverns of the night these constellations we now mark when we were not in formless dark a poet centuries before would watch from the italian shoredrop in the sea and mindful earthhad made him mortal from his birth he set on high his musics barsamong the everlasting stars to those to come clear warning signto place no faith in the divine for sacred to the pole unfurledabove and compassing the world these songs yet suffered sad disgraceand almost sank without a trace though to our strand this wreckage came it scarcely owned its authors name mine not to exhort the godsor stars that vex our mortal odds but love of virtue quick to fademakes me seek fame with human aid a man i chose a man to standat this front page and my right hand who thrive or perish in my pages brief friend your name should last the ages i send these lines to you who wentwhere stars rise in the orient from here where constellations sinkbelow the oceans western brink take them for that day will cometo add us to the canceled sumand give our bones to earth to rot for we have no immortal lot and souls that will not last forever and the chain of comrades sever of like importance is the posture too in which the genial feat of love we do for as the females of the four foot kind receive the leapings of their males behind so the good wives with loins uplifted high and leaning on their hands the fruitful stroke may try for in that posture will they best conceive not when supinely laid they frisk and heave for active motions only break the blow and more of strumpets than of wives they show when answering stroke with stroke the mingled liquors flow endearments eager and too brisk a bound throws off the plow share from the furrowd ground but common harlots in conjunction heave because tis less their business to conceive than to delight and to provoke the deed a trick which honest wives but little need how is your life with that other one simpler is it a stroke of the oarsand a long coastline and the memory of meis soon a drifting island not in the ocean in the sky souls you will be sisters sisters not lovers how is your life with an ordinarywoman without the god inside her the queen supplanted how do you breathe now flinch waking up what do you do poor man hysterics and interruptions enough ill rent my own house how is your life with that other you my own is the breakfast delicious if you get sick dont blame me how is it living with a postcard you who stood on sinai hows your life with a touriston earth her rib do you love her is it to your liking hows life do you cough do you hum to drown out the mice in your mind how do you live with cheap goods is the market rising hows kissing plaster dust are you bored with her new body hows it going with an earthly woman with no sixth sense are you happy no in a shallow pit how is your life my beloved hard as minewith another man just when im ready to call in the day and put it to bed without supper you send the mockingbird who plays with his musical zipper exposing the worlds underlife you send purfume from the autumn olive whose septillion flowering ears are full of bees singing songs for the revolution out back jakes creek is speaking in tongues missed you missed you missed you you wear me down obsessively rubbing your hands along my better judgment kissing the upturned noses of all my higher principles until my clothes are big as a mast sail until my longing leavens one thousand wedding cakes my longing is an undertow and all the tourist beaches are posted danger come for me ill break off my arms and will them to a body of water hang my legs up in overalls at night so they wont come after us feed english to the birds in sweet pats of butter then our loving gets raucous white moths yapping their wings you wag you wag in the little fingerbowl of me your verbstem assumes declensions of mythic proportions my vowel sounds open on the south most hallelujah side of the mountain then metaphysically speaking weve stopped speaking metaphorically silence nuanced as a landscape in snow some day when trees have shed their leaves and against the mornings white the shivering birds beneath the eaves have sheltered for the night well turn our faces southward love toward the summer isle where bamboos spire the shafted grove and wide mouthed orchids smile and we will seek the quiet hill where towers the cotton tree and leaps the laughing crystal rill and works the droning bee and we will build a cottage there beside an open glade with black ribbed blue bells blowing near and ferns that never fade all this tall grass has ruined my gold acrylic nails i know somethings dead just beyond my window i grew up with rats running my floorboards know the smell straining from a body once caught in a trap in the city what little i have of an ass is always out a simple wind blow from marilyn monroe ing the street here in all this nature there is nobody but me my friends for a week i promised myself id be naked but the first day i found a tick clinging to my arm hair for dear life decided no way im exposing my pussy to the elements my love for nature is like my love for most things fickle theoretical too many bugs i want a divorce last week before i was here my uncle drove me from our city to the suburbs sang project chick in the car when we parked he asked me to take off my shoes there we walked silent barefoot circling the lake trying to not step in goose shit he walked in front i trailed behind both our hands clasped behind our backs when you were my daughter those were the happiest days of my life i wish you would come home my love for the past is like my love for most things i only feel it when im gone best to stay gone so im always in love if i look at something too long it forgets its joy all the floorboards carry death my gold nails are fake chipped my bare feet skirt the shit ye tender young virgins attend to my lay my heart is divided in twain my collin is beautiful witty and gay and damons a kind hearted swain whenever my lovely young collin i meet what pleasures arise in my breast the dear gentle swain looks so charming and sweet i fancy i love him the best but when my dear damon does to me complain so tender so loving and kind my bosom is softened to hear the fond swain and collin slips out of my mind whenever my damon repeats his soft tale my heart overflows with delight but when my dear collin appears in the vale i languish away at the sight tis collin alone shall possess my fond heart now damon for ever adieu but can i i cannot from damon thus part hes loved me so long and so true my heart to my damon ill instantly bind and on him will fix all my care but o should i be to my collin unkind he surely will die with despair how happy how happy with damon id been if collin i never had knew as happy with collin if id never seen my damon so tender and true i was too shy to say anything but your poems are so beautiful what kinds of things feelings or ideas inspire you i mean outside the raw experiences of your life he turned a strange crosshatched color as if he stood in a clouded painting and said thanks but no other phenomena intrude upon my starlit mind i see you are wondering what this is all about dont mind me im talking to myself again yes poetry is nice and often beautiful yet it doesnt beget much attention money or even a simple thanks for placing the best words in the best order thats when i forget all about your incessant demands and the restless subject leaps the stream in technicolor until the remembrancer appears and says stop this wasteful life doctor lawyer thief these fancies of yours could cost a life or worse two meanwhile he perceives my gifted body upholding my mind as im explaining my stuff on the unicorn tapestries cheeks starting to color feathers ruffling quiet shudders he shrugs your content sounds too beautiful but id like to read it sometime okay he says all the right things like i love you hyacinth girl things get interesting until the sudden blow thanks for the memories what ill think seeing his new work in the new yorker is thanks for nothing asshole as he drops me for that prolific pastoral life with his wife upstate the more i think about it it all depends upon your phantom attention surely a world embroiders itself in ones mind at any moment words resounding ardent present clarifyingly beautiful and beautifully truthful you know here i should put in a lapis color or a murky midnight blue or have the crowd stagger by in a riot of color pinning down the helpless beast with spears and ritualistic thanks to their gods what one really wants to get at is the real the eternally beautiful like the white album or something thats what makes one perilous life worth living all the brute indifference humiliation and failure can put one in the mind to give up freak out kill somebody heart battered so mastered oh you wherever i go on the subway in my cubicle at play in sleep its always you of the air overpowering my senses like a dutch master in one pure color its fiction at full speed walls breaking a clarity panorama for the mind hunting for meaning and finding it at last now look at all the work i did and not one thanks not even flowers off you rush to watch him accept another award in that life we can only dream of from where you sit it all seems so beautiful and i finally understand you for that i cant express enough thanks as the subject is the best color for me in the difficulty of this lonely life its always caught up in my mind what could be more beautiful beside a spreading elm from whose high boughs like knotted tufts the crows light dwelling shows where screened from northern blasts and winter proof snug stands the parsons barn with thatched roof at chaff strewed door where in the morning ray the gilded motes in mazy circles play and sleepy comrade in the sun is laid more grateful to the cur than neighbouring shade in snowy shirt unbraced brown robin stood and leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood his full round cheek where deeper flushes glow the dewy drops which glisten on his brow his dark cropped pate that erst at church or fair so smooth and silky showed his mornings care which all uncouth in matted locks combined now ends erect defies the ruffling wind his neck band loose and hosen rumpled low a careful lad nor slack at labour show nor scraping chickens chirping mongst the straw nor croaking rook oerhead nor chattering daw loud breathing cow amongst the rampy weeds nor grunting sow that in the furrows feeds nor sudden breeze that shakes the quaking leaves and lightly rustles through the scattered sheaves nor floating straw that skims athwart his nose the deeply musing youth may discompose for nelly fair the blithest village maid whose tuneful voice beneath the hedgerow shade at early milking oer the meadows borne eer cheered the ploughmans toil at rising morn the neatest maid that eer in linen gown bore cream and butter to the market town the tightest lass that with untutored air eer footed alehouse floor at wake or fair since easter last had robins heart possessed and many a time disturbed his nightly rest full oft returning from the loosened plough he slacked his pace and knit his thoughtful brow and oft ere half his threshers talk was oer would muse with arms across at cooling door his mind thus bent with downcast eyes he stood and leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood his soul oer many a soft rememberance ran and muttering to himself the youth began ah happy is the man whose early lot hath made him master of a furnished cot who trains the vine that round his window grows and after setting sun his garden hoes whose wattled pales his own enclosure shield who toils not daily in anothers field whereeer he goes to church or market town with more respect he and his dog are known a brisker face he wears at wake or fair nor views with longing eyes the pedlars ware but buys at will or ribbands gloves or beads and willing maidens to the alehouse leads and oh secure from toils which cumber life he makes the maid he loves an easy wife ah nelly canst thou with contented mind become the helpmate of a labouring hind and share his lot whateer the chances be who hath no dower but love to fix on thee yes gayest maid may meekest matron prove and things of little note may token love when from the church thou camst at eventide and i and red haired susan by thy side i pulled the blossoms from the bending tree and some to susan gave and some to thee thine were the best and well thy smiling eye the difference marked and guessed the reason why when on a holiday we rambling strayed and passed old hodges cottage in the glade neat was the garden dressed sweet hummed the bee i wished both cot and nelly made for me and well methought thy very eyes revealed the self same wish within thy breast concealed when artful once i sought my love to tell and spoke to thee of one who loved thee well you saw the cheat and jeering homeward hied yet secret pleasure in thy looks i spied ay gayest maid may meekest matron prove and smaller signs than these have tokened love now at a distance on the neighbouring plain with creaking wheels slow comes the heavy wain high on its towering load a maid appears and nellys voice sounds shrill in robins ears quick from his hand he throws the cumbrous flail and leaps with lightsome limbs the enclosing pale oer field and fence he scours and furrows wide with wakened comrade barking by his side whilst tracks of trodden grain and sidelong hay and broken hedge flowers sweet mark his impetuous way i in a courtyard in these stacks of chairs before the empty stage near arewe lord near and graspable lord accept these humble offerings stacks of biscuits wrapped in cellophane stacks of bone in glass thighbone spine stacks of white saucers porcelain circles into which stacks of lip worn cups slide neat jawbone lord galleries of laminated clippings declaring war hands unstack chairs into rows the dead they still go begging what for lord blunt bayonets once sharp as wind moon pale stacks of clavicle a hand ii moon pale stacks of clavicle a hand brushes dust from i lost a word that was left to me sister the wind severs through us we sit wait for songs of nation and loss in neat long rows below this leaf green flag its red stitched circle stains us blood bright blossom stains us river silk i saw you sister standing in this brilliance i saw light sawing through a broken car window thistling us pink i saw sister your bleeding head an unfurling shapla flower petaling slow across mute water iii petaling slow across mute water bows of trawlers skimming nets of silver fish that ripple through open hands that will carve them skin less we were hands we scooped the darkness empty we are rooted bodies in rows silent before the sparked blue limbs of dancers leafing the dark light indigo then jasmine alighting into a cup then hands overturning postcards bearing flag and flower hands cradling the replica of a boat hands thrust there and into nothingness you a corpse sister bathed jasmine blue iv a corpse sister bathed jasmine blue the light leading me from this gift shop into a gallery of gray stones heartgray puddles two mouthfuls of silence the shadow cast by the portrait of a raped woman trapped in a frame face hidden behind her own black river of hair photo that a solemn girl your corpses age stands still and small before she asks did someone hurt her did she do something bad her mother does not reply her father turns shudders as the light drinks our silences parched as i too turn in light spine scraped you teach you teach your hands to sleep v you teach you teach your hands to sleep because her hands cant hold the shape of a shapla flower cut from its green leaf because her hands cant hold grief nor light nor sister in her hands fistfuls of her own hair on her wrists glass bangles like the one you struggled over your hand the same hand that slapped a sisters wan face look the young girl stands before the photo of the young woman who swore she would not become the old woman crouched low on a jute mat holding out to you a bangle a strange lostness wasbodily present you came near to living vi bodily present you came near to living poet in this small blue dress still stained the placard states with the blood of the child crushed dead by a soldiers boot who failed and fails nights you couldnt bear the threshed sounds of your hearts hard beating i press a button springs forth black and white bodies marching in pixelated rows nights you resuscitated the word sea overflowed star overflown a pixelated woman tied with a white rope to a black pole her white sari embroidered with mud or blood nights you were the wax to seal whats unwritten the screen goes white in downdrifting light vii the screen goes white in downdrifting light the stairwell is a charred tunnel we walk out of it into the couttyard my skirt flares a rent into the burnt evening something was silent something went its way something gnashes inside me sister along the yellow gashes of paint guiding me through these rooms lined with glass cases past machine gun chains shaped into the word bangla here on this stage a dancer bows low her limbs once more before us the stage goes silent we gather ourselves souvenirs of bone pray lord we are near near are we lord in a courtyard in these stacks of chairs if i had but two little wings and were a little feathery bird to you id fly my dear but thoughts like these are idle things and i stay here but in my sleep to you i fly im always with you in my sleep the world is all ones own but then one wakes and where am i all all alone sleep stays not though a monarch bids so i love to wake ere break of day for though my sleep be gone yet while tis dark one shuts ones lids and still dreams on my husband and i were arguing about a bench we wanted to buy and put in part of our backyard a part which is actually a meadow of sorts a half acre with tall grasses and weeds and the occasional wild flower because we do not mow it but leave it scrubby and unkempt this bench would hardly ever be used and in summer when the grasses were high would remain partially hidden from view we both knew we wanted the bench to be made of teak so that it would last a long time in the harsh weather and so that we would never have to paint it teak weathers to a soft silver that might in november or march disappear into the gray hills that are the backdrop of our lives my husband wanted a four foot bench and i wanted a five foot bench this is what we argued about my husband insisted that a four foot bench was all we needed since no more than two people presumably ourselves would ever sit on it at the same time i felt his reasoning was not only beside the point but missed it entirely i said what mattered most to me was the idea of the bench the look of it there to be gazed at with only the vaguest notion it could hold more people than would ever actually sit down the life of the bench in my imagination was more important than any practical function the bench might serve after all i argued we wanted a bench so that we could look at it so that we could imagine sitting on it so that unexpectedly a bird might sit on it or fallen leaves or inches of snow and the longer the bench the greater the expanse of that plank the more it matched its true function which was imaginary my husband mentioned money and i said that i was happier to have no bench at all which would cost nothing than to have a four foot bench which would be expensive i said that having no bench at all was closer to the five foot bench than the four foot bench because having no bench served the imagination in similar ways and so not having a bench became an option in our argument became a third bench we grew very tired of discussing the three benches and for a day we rested from our argument during this day i had many things to do and many of them involved my driving past other houses none of which had benches that is they each had the third bench and as i drove past the other houses i could see a bench here and a bench there sometimes i saw the bench very close to the house against a wall or on a porch and sometimes i saw the bench under a tree or in the open grass cut or uncut and once i saw the bench at the end of the driveway blocking the road always it was a five foot bench that i saw a long sleek bench or a broken down bench a bench with a slatted back or a bench with a solid carved back and always the bench was empty but i knew that for my husband the third bench was only four feet long and he saw always two people sitting on it two happy or tired people two people who were happy to be alive or two people tired from having worked hard enough to buy the bench they were sitting on or they were happy and tired happy to have reached the end of some argument tired from having had it for these people the bench was an emblem of their days which were fruitful because their suffering had come to an end on my bench which was always empty nothing had come to an end because nothing had begun no one had sat down though the bench was always there waiting for exactly that to happen and the bench was always long enough so that someone if he desired to could lie all the way down that day passed another day followed it and my husband and i began once more to discuss the bench the sound of our voices revealed a renewed interest and vigor i thought i sensed in him a coming around to my view of the bench and i know he sensed in me a coming around to his view of the bench because at one point i said that a four foot bench reminded me of rough notes towards a real bench while a five foot bench was like a fragment of an even longer bench and i admitted it was at times hard to tell the difference he said he didnt know anything about the difference between rough notes and fragments but he agreed that between the two benches there was possibly just perhaps he could imagine it very little difference it was after all only a foot we were talking about and i think it was then in both of our minds that a fourth bench came into being a bench that was only a foot long a miniature bench a bench we could build ourselves though of course we did not this seemed to be essentially the bench we were talking about much later when the birds came back or the leaves drifted downwards or the snow fell slowly and lightly at first then heavier and faster it was this bench that we both saw when we looked out the window at the bench we eventually placed in the meadow which continued to grow as if there were no bench at all it has never been so easy to cry openly or to acknowledge children never before could i walk directly to the center of an island city feeling the automatism of millions drawing one pious breath shouldering the sunset holding it up in the oily tree line a while longer years ago i was never sad enough and nothing but a hotel that i could tear to pieces and reconstruct inside a shoebox felt like home my parents died their miserable possessions washed up in other hotels dioramas of the febrile romantic i take my first lover already gray at her temples and more reticent than shy more tacit than admiring to the bus stop by the jewish museum we wait in the dark a long time she does not kiss me she hurries up out of the oily street onto the humming fluorescent podium of the last bus where i see her a last time not waving to me not lovable erect in the freedom we traduced years ago in our first kiss never deny the power of withdrawal never doubt that thought and time make things small never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed uncomprehending gesture at childhoods end none can tell happiness from buoyancy none of it made any difference the patricides the hotels ill constructed the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion we are no more complicated than our great grandparents who dreaded the hotel life like them we seek the refuge of warm days in january a piety whose compulsion is to survive according to explicit laws no young woman adores or young man follows with darling hunger o love thou art winged and swift yet stay with me evermore and i guarded my house with bolt and bar lest love fly forth at the door without in the world t was cold while love and i together laughed and sang by my red hearth fire nor knew it was winter weather sweet love would lull me to sleep in his tireless arm caressed his shadowing wings and burning eyes like night and stars wrought rest and ever the beat of loves heart as a chime rang at my ear and ever loves bending beautiful face covered me close from fear was it long ere i waked alone a snow drift whitened the floor i saw spent ashes upon my hearth and death in my open door by woman so touched so pressed detachment being thought achievable at all is boggling in itself its being thought achievable by love but love for only all not someones single sentience appears the precept of too cold a form of flame how much of a hand in things relinquishes the hold of things at hand what kiss might such a mind reclaim a swirl of dust in buddhist schools perhaps a view of several solar systems from above not love the thought appeals as it appals slow learners we must spurn the selving sensualities to feel for feelers of this kind unfasten passions burner to identify whats under it in short must court dispassion just to be compassionate tonight nothing is long enough time isn t were there a fire it would burn now were there a heaven i would have gone long ago i think that light is the final image but time reoccurs love and an echo a time passes love in the dark pass by the showy rose blabbing open suckling a shiny beetle pass by the changeless diamond that falls asleep in shadow this love is a lichen alga and fungus made one fleck feeding on what it feeds growing slightly faster than stone into a patch of gray lace a double thumbprint its bloom distinguishable with practice from its dormant phase crocheting its singular habit over time a faithful stain bound to its home etching on the unmoved rock the only rune it knows the long love that in my thought doth harbour and in mine hert doth keep his residence into my face presseth with bold pretence and therein campeth spreading his banner she that me learneth to love and suffer and will that my trust and lust s negligence be rayned by reason shame and reverence with his hardiness taketh displeasure wherewithall unto the herts forest he fleeth leaving his enterprise with pain and cry and there him hideth and not appeareth what may i do when my master feareth but in the field with him to live and die for good is the life ending faithfully he felt the wild beast in him betweenwhiles so masterfully rude that he would grieve to see the helpless delicate thing receive his guardianship through certain dark defiles had he not teeth to rend and hunger too but still he spared her once have you no fear he said twas dusk she in his grasp none near she laughed no surely am i not with you and uttering that soft starry you she leaned her gentle body near him looking up and from her eyes as from a poison cup he drank until the flittering eyelids screened devilish malignant witch and oh young beam of heavens circle glory here they shape to squeeze like an intoxicating grape i might and yet thou goest safe supreme i dont want to be alive anymore i dont want to be alive enough to want that one is not meant to turn on ones creator with ferocity expendable in only one way or is that exactly how one is meant to turn to burn beyond the love that from beyond being has come to us christs ever unhearable and thus always too bearable scream in love and dread we learn to listen for beloved dread coming upon us like a whiplash rain we watch through a window in pain we learn pain sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia there gleams a scalpel blade so clean with meaning so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue that drawing it in season due across my own throat there comes not blood but an ancient answering starlight once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice with a view of sky contempted skyscrapers and lake michigans immaculate sewage my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels my soul deadword die to find it for self pity there must remain a self ah but even shitting ones self one still finds ones self hastening to hide it all from the kind ukranian nearly bearded night nurse fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs my diaphanous shoulders the very air eating me like a late leaf that once i would have flourished for a perishable lover or lonelied like some catpiss poignancy into a poem dead brain living will little pills entangling pain with adoration of it morphine machine whose little beep heavenly bell conjures me to the suddenly more tolerable hallways of hell lovely leila so unsurgically curved disclosing as she leans to clean my lines a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace of a glacier the brain the brain the brain flickering electrically in and out in out not the mind in which i love my wife whose tightwound nightmind conjures christ in diapers for instance filthy infant or later in a mist of adolescent bad weather bored of wood dogdead judea squawk box god some restless absurdity of earth she says through which the rest of heaven can come once upon a time i walked through the chemical glamour of a night refinery sparking dangerously without and within for beside me under her underclothes undulated an incarnation of creations finest failure moonskin to make a young man wince coupled with stifling innocence still we managed and over the wrought iron railing of the country club to which neither of us could possibly belong in the moonskinned pool that seemed both to embody and imbibe her we improved and later out on a green to be sixteen when the starshower i thought was mine was mining me for sweat muscle memory to make its own death shine unceasingly inside of me even unto hell we excelled can it be that her last name was really key so much life in this poem so much salvageable and saving love but it is i fear i swear i tear open what heart i have left to keep it from being and beating and bearing down upon me what rest in faith wrested from grief what truce with truth in bowing down not to the ground of being but simply to the ground affliction flickers distant now like a structure on fire loves reprieve moves through me like a breeze but antlike existence crawls all over me lord and i cry out if you call this vise quiet a cry this riot of needs and genes an i feelingly among the bones and nerves of sounds i make my scathing way failingly in church or in the parked car before work i try to pray what might it mean to surrender to the wonder nothing means not to end with a little flourish of earth not to end love is the living heart of dread love i love you unto the very edge of being dead something in us suffering touches teaches first to find little coves in our loves blank nothings wherein we are what we always were blank nothings but changed or rearranged as atoms in the random kingdom of things hand we say or eye or hair as if to make ourselves to stake ourselves truly there knowing now not to move in time we are moved by tiger striped tails bloodfine fins some natureless cerulean one would say thinking oneself out of nature something in us suffering touches torches so we may saunter seeingly through an altogether other element as once in the shedd aquarium in chicago i floated a moment with my love and the two new lives borne from us who loved best the eensy green almost unfish more like the stars when you close your eyes and whirl open to the whirling grains so freed from things you fall down laughing at the havoc for me for a long time not the minnows mattered but the pattern after miraculous i didnt think to think all those mite eyes and animate instants answering at once to my need and to nothing as if my very nerves worked in finally a saving sense something in us touches suffering touching us like the constellations of kinetic quiet that bound us beyond us as right to the wall the girls pressed their still forming faces through which the wild new schools flew almost too green too blue to stand and i held your hand the first act of love in a new house is not private loving each other we are half aware of door and mirror our ecstasy includes the bedside chair the air from the landing street lamp and elm utter leaves on walls as in no room ever theirs is the tongue our tongues join in translating their message is clear tonight you cannot ignore the world at the window so we love in the knowledge of a city at a different angle and sharing our bed with furniture and tree we claim their perspective merging our lives here in their established frame at first we had ways of talking that filled up the evening until some things could be said it was a made up situation in which lives could be lost whatever that was now grows inside our bodies a spongy pulpy cell causing pieces of paper we hold in our hands to appear and disappear all i ask is to take me away from this place to another place very much like this place where we can meet and six months later be married you laughed and went with me still sits the school house by the road a ragged beggar sleeping around it still the sumachs grow and blackberry vines are creeping within the masters desk is seen deep scarred by raps official the warping floor the battered seats the jack knifes carved initial the charcoal frescos on its wall its doors worn sill betraying the feet that creeping slow to school went storming out to playing long years ago a winter sun shone over it at setting lit up its western window panes and low eaves icy fretting it touched the tangled golden curls and brown eyes full of grieving of one who still her steps delayed when all the school were leaving for near her stood the little boy her childish favor singled his cap pulled low upon a face where pride and shame were mingled pushing with restless feet the snow to right and left he lingered as restlessly her tiny hands the blue checked apron fingered he saw her lift her eyes he felt the soft hands light caressing and heard the tremble of her voice as if a fault confessing im sorry that i spelt the word i hate to go above you because the brown eyes lower fell because you see i love you still memory to a gray haired man that sweet child face is showing dear girl the grasses on her grave have forty years been growing he lives to learn in lifes hard school how few who pass above him lament their triumph and his loss like her because they love him how often now raging weeping for the dayslove gives then takes away takes from youthe slightly chapped hand laid on the oneyoure pointing at a tree and the voice that breathes coffeeberry bush into your mouth the finger that taps and feathers your earbut the giggles gone before you turn around the sandalwood scent hanging in the room the auburn strand like a flaw in the porcelain the off course nail clipping in the carpet the days eat into your stomach knife youwith longing for relief from lovethat you cannot leave or leave alone from its rings of fire where you wontburn down to ash or be transformed you become them and they keep burningand have a coffeeberry voice listen how their rhymes sing the little deaths you live what is the structure of lipsthat take care of sounds that can scream loud and long that can wait and be silent yesterday i was mastering wordsand kissing lips

like moist fingers appear before me full of promise but then run away to a narrow black room that is always dark where they are silent elegant like antique gold devouring the thing i feel i want the force of attraction to crush the force of repulsion and my inner and outer worlds to pierce one another like a horse whipped by a man i dont want words to sever me from reality i dont want to need them i want nothing to reveal feeling but feeling as in freedom or the knowledge of peace in a realm beyond or the sound of water poured in a bowl the first hot april day the granite step was warm flies droned in the grass when a car went past they rose in unison then dropped back down i saw that a yellow crocus bud had pierced a dead oak leaf then opened wide how strong its appetite for the luxury of the sun everyone longs for loves tense joy and red delights and then i spied an ant dragging a ragged disembodied wing up the warm brick walk it must have been the methodist in me that leaned forward preceded by my shadow to put a twig just where the ant was struggling with its own desire since there is no escape since at the end my body will be utterly destroyed this hand i love as i have loved a friend this body i tended wept with and enjoyed since there is no escape even for me who love life with a love too sharp to bear the scent of orchards in the rain the sea and hours alone too still and sure for prayer since darkness waits for me then all the more let me go down as waves sweep to the shore in pride and let me sing with my last breath in these few hours of light i lift my head life is my lover i shall leave the dead if there is any way to baffle death i felt suddenly convinced that i had feelings for the wallpaper i was especially captivated by its blonde hair and bad dreams i had the impression the wallpaper needed longer to properly respond by the time i left my affections had produced this abrasion on my cheek people looked on the abrasion as unquestionable proof of my sincerity the abrasion was produced by rubbing my face on the papers smooth surface it only occurred to me later that it might have found this sensation disagreeable but by then i had become known for my abrasion and i seldom thought of discussed or in any way depended upon the wallpaper for anything my affections though had produced upon the paper their own mark to my irritation and gradual dismay interest in the papers abrasionbegan to outweigh interest in my own indeed mine was starting to fadewhile the mark upon the paper had deepened with the passing of time people liked to visit the paper in its room and probe their fingersinto the widening tear by now a gruesome black edged wound the silence of the paper during these incursions suggested to somecondemnation of their curiosity but to others implied approval some even speculated that the paper enjoyed the infringementof its surfaces while most agreed it was a question of the paperenduring this indignity having little or no opportunity to protest some visitors could not contain their enthusiasm and over timeother recesses were opened in the paper without its consent the earliest admirers of the papers abrasion were heard lamentingthe gulf between the papers current state and its previous appearance they opined that to experience the abrasion now was to encountera kind of mockery of the gentle and informal gesture it had once been others contended that while the papers condition was certainly different it couldnt be in any way better or worse than it had been originally on the contrary the paper exhibiting as it did the marks of the affectionsspent upon it was in every way a true record of the destruction this attentionhad wrought and had become if anything a more moving testament charting as it did the changing and accelerated passions of the times in later phases of the papers deterioration some expressed admirationfor the stoical indifference with which the paper withstood its abusersand wondered if such an attitude might not improve the willingand reciprocal style with which they and their contemporarieswere accustomed to receiving each others gazes and caresses against the odds this view seemed timely and took root in the populace and to this day in all the estimations of historians and critics of cultureit is widely held accountable for the period of dormancy and inertiaamong the youngest of our people whose silence and reposehas replaced the humors and rages of those whose desires had flown unchecked who had coupled for so long with such energy and frequency so well go no more a roving so late into the night though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright for the sword outwears its sheath and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe and love itself have rest though the night was made for loving and the day returns too soon yet well go no more a roving by the light of the moon and to the curious i say dont be na ve the soul like a trinket is a she i lay down in the tweed of one man that first frost night i did not like the wool of him you have one mitochondrial speck of evidence on your cleat they can take you down for that did i forget to mention that when youre deadyoure dead a long time my uncle dying told me this when asked why stay here for such suffering a chimney swift flits through the fumatorium i long for one last blue democracy which has broke my heart a while how many minutes have i left the lover asked to still be beautiful i took his blond face in my hands and kissed him blondly on his mouth still to be neat still to be dressed as you were going to a feast still to be powdered still perfumed lady it is to be presumed though arts hid causes are not found all is not sweet all is not sound give me a look give me a face that makes simplicity a grace robes loosely flowing hair as free such sweet neglect more taketh me than all thadulteries of art they strike mine eyes but not my heart who will in fairest book of nature know how virtue may best lodgd in beauty be let him but learn of love to read in thee stella those fair lines which true goodness show there shall he find all vices overthrow not by rude force but sweetest sovereignty of reason from whose light those night birds fly that inward sun in thine eyes shineth so and not content to be perfections heir thyself dost strive all minds that way to move who mark in thee what is in thee most fair so while thy beauty draws thy heart to love as fast thy virtue bends that love to good but ah desire still cries give me some food i shall never get you put together entirely pieced glued and properly jointed mule bray pig grunt and bawdy cackles proceed from your great lips its worse than a barnyard perhaps you consider yourself an oracle mouthpiece of the dead or of some god or other thirty years now i have labored to dredge the silt from your throat i am none the wiser scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol i crawl like an ant in mourning over the weedy acres of your brow to mend the immense skull plates and clear the bald white tumuli of your eyes a blue sky out of the oresteia arches above us o father all by yourself you are pithy and historical as the roman forum i open my lunch on a hill of black cypress your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered in their old anarchy to the horizon line it would take more than a lightning stroke to create such a ruin nights i squat in the cornucopia of your left ear out of the wind counting the red stars and those of plum color the sun rises under the pillar of your tongue my hours are married to shadow no longer do i listen for the scrape of a keel on the blank stones of the landing clouds spout upon her their waters amain in ruthless disdain her who but lately had shivered with pain as at touch of dishonour if there had lit on her so coldly so straightly such arrows of rain one who to shelter her delicate head would quicken and quicken each tentative tread if drops chanced to pelt her that summertime spills in dust paven rills when thunder clouds thicken and birds close their bills would that i lay there and she were housed here or better together were folded away there exposed to one weather we both who would stray there when sunny the day there or evening was clear at the prime of the year soon will be growing green blades from her mound and daisies be showing like stars on the ground till she form part of them ay the sweet heart of them loved beyond measure with a childs pleasure all her lifes round kurt early twenties met him after an aa meeting in silverlake november eighty five i remem ber standing with him up stairs in the clubhouse how i checked his body out but not who approached whom or what we talked about before we leaned against my car and kissed under that tarnished l a moon drove to my place and un dressed him in the dark he was smaller than me i couldnt keep my hands off his ass next morning smoked till he woke took him back he thanked me sweetly i couldnt have said what i wanted though must have known drove home and put him in a poem november i was at the end of later that day it rained i know from the poem her face her tongue her wit so fair so sweet so sharp first bent then drew then hit mine eye mine ear my heart mine eye mine ear my heart to like to learn to love her face her tongue her wit doth lead doth teach doth move her face her tongue her wit with beams with sound with art doth blind doth charm doth knit mine eye mine ear my heart mine eye mine ear my heart with life with hope with skill her face her tongue her wit doth feed doth feast doth fill o face o tongue o wit with frowns with checks with smart wrong not vex not wound not mine eye mine ear my heart this eye this ear this heart shall joy shall yield shall swear her face her tongue her wit to serve to trust to fear for our own private reasons we live in each other for an hour stranger i take your body and its seasons aware the moon has gone a little sour for us the moon hangs up there like a stone shaken out of its proper setting we lie down in each other we lie down alone and watch the moons flawed marble getting out of hand what are the dead doing tonight the padlocks of their tongues embrace the black each syllable locked in place tucked out of sight even this moon could never pull them back even if it held them in its arms and weighed them down with stones took them entirely on their own terms and piled the orchards blossom on their bones i am aware of your body and its dangers i spread my cloak for you in leafy weather where other fugitives and other strangers will put their mouths together in summers heat and mid time of the day to rest my limbs upon a bed i lay one window shut the other open stood which gave such light as twinkles in a wood like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun or night being past and yet not day begun such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown where they may sport and seem to be unknown then came corinna in a long loose gown her white neck hid with tresses hanging down resembling fair semiramis going to bed or la s of a thousand wooers sped i snatched her gown being thin the harm was small yet strived she to be covered therewithal and striving thus as one that would be cast betrayed herself and yielded at the last stark naked as she stood before mine eye not one wen in her body could i spy what arms and shoulders did i touch and see how apt her breasts were to be pressed by me how smooth a belly under her waist saw i how large a leg and what a lusty thigh to leave the rest all liked me passing well i clinged her naked body down she fell judge you the rest being tired she bad me kiss jove send me more such afternoons as this the first line is a row of girls twenty five of them almost a painting shoulders overlapping angled slightly toward you one says im myself here the others shudder and laugh through the ribbon core that strings them they make a tone tighter by drumming on their thighs and opening their mouths the girls are cells the girls are a fence a fibrous network one by one they describe their grievances large hot malfunctioning machines lie obediently at their sides their shirts are various shades of ease in the surrounding air which is littered with small cuts one will choose you press you into the ground you may never recover the second to last line has a fold in it the last line is the steady pour of their names it was overcast no hour at all was indicated by the gnomon with difficulty i made out the slogan time and tide wait for no man i had been waiting for you daphne underneath the dripping laurels near the sundial glade where first we met i felt like hamlet on the parapets of elsinore alerted to the ectoplasmic moment when luna rends her shroud of cloud and sails into a starry archipelago then your revenant appeared and spake aloud i am not who you think i am for what we used to be is gone the moments over whatever years you thought we spent together you dont know the story and moreover you mistook the drinking fountain for a sundial i put my lips to its whatever and with difficulty i made out the slogan drink from me and you shall live forever this guy i know a rabbi friday nights on his way home before sunset in winter always stops at a florist or bodega and buys a bunch of flowers for his wife every week the same a ritual regardless of her mood that morning fresh upsets at work or snarling on the bridge he brings her roses wrapped in cellophane but isnt there a ring of hokiness in that why should a good man have to show his devotion some things go unspoken some things get tested on the real world and isnt that the place that matters most so when you told me i should bring you flowers i joked but dont i show my feelings more in dog walks diapers and rewiring lamps the flowers i learned later werent for wooing not for affection in long marriage but for something seeded even deeper down through frost heaves and which might be roughly peace its funny that i just assumed romance now theres no peace with us i wonder what they might have meant to you those simple tokens holding in sight what no rite can grow back youd think the sky would run out of water but it wont it just keeps coming down i need someone to marvel at the breath escaping from me do you have a natural resource you prefer to exploit does someone think of you and turn the channel how would you ever know have you ever zoned out during downton abbey im certain of something id prefer not to tell you about slow down you say but i can already see my breath and its only october walking with you is making everything watery and spazzed out like a movie about sex where i have sex and people are all like hes amazing we really like his sex style but i digress will you please stand up when called upon to tell the audience how wonderful i was in my best moments like someone in senior management delegating things and being sure of everything but how to stop i promise ill make this up to you ill write your name on the menu board and people will come into the store all expectant of you in the close covert of a grove by nature formed for scenes of love said susan in a lucky hour observe yon sweet geranium flower how straight upon its stalk it stands and tempts our violating hands whilst the soft bud as yet unspread hangs down its pale declining head yet soon as it is ripe to blow the stems shall rise the head shall glow nature said i my lovely sue to all her followers lends a clue her simple laws themselves explain as links of one continued chain for her the mysteries of creation are but the works of generation yon blushing strong triumphant flower is in the crisis of its power but short alas its vigorous reign he sheds his seed and drops again the bud that hangs in pale decay feels not as yet the plastic ray tomorrows sun shall bid him rise then too he sheds his seed and dies but words my love are vain and weak for proof let bright example speak then straight before the wondering maid the tree of life i gently laid observe sweet sue his drooping head how pale how languid and how dead yet let the sun of thy bright eyes shine but a moment it shall rise let but the dew of thy soft hand refresh the stem it straight shall stand already see it swells it grows its head is redder than the rose its shriveled fruit of dusky hue now glows a present fit for sue the balm of life each artery fills and in oerflowing drops distils oh me cried susan when is this what strange tumultuous throbs of bliss sure never mortal till this hour felt such emotion at a flower oh serpent cunning to deceive sure tis this tree that tempted eve the crimson apples hang so fair alas what woman could forbear well hast thou guessed my love i cried it is the tree by which she died the tree which could alone content her all nature susan seeks the centre yet let us still poor eve forgive its the tree by which we live for lovely women still it grows and in the centre only blows but chief for thee it spreads its charms for paradise is in thy arms i ceased for nature kindly here began to whisper in her ear and lovely sue lay softly panting while the geranium tree was planting til in the heat of amorous strife she burst the mellow tree of life oh heaven cried susan with a sigh the hour we taste we surely die strange raptures seize my fainting frame and all my body glows with flame yet let me snatch one parting kiss to tell my love i die with bliss that pleased thy susan yields her breath oh who would live if this be death when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutored youth unlearn d in the worlds false subtleties thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her false speaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust and wherefore say not i that i am old oh loves best habit is in seeming trust and age in love loves not to have years told therefore i lie with her and she with me and in our faults by lies we flattered be two sisters of ancient greece both laid claimto the finest fairest rear of their time which tail forged ahead which bottoms true fametopped which back was in front which terce most prime a judge chose the elder girls back matter her finish was more fine and far matter she got the prize and his heart soon they wed but the youngers sitters not a smatterless meet ill marry her his brother said it went so well their joys were so perfected that after them a temple was erectedin honor of venus callipygus no other church though i dont know its rite could so from head to epididymis move me with deep devotion to its site translated from the french of jean de la fontaine contes part i asleep or waking is it for her neck kissed over close wears yet a purple speck wherein the pained blood falters and goes out soft and stung softly fairer for a fleck but though my lips shut sucking on the place there is no vein at work upon her face her eyelids are so peaceable no doubt deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways lo this is she that was the worlds delight the old grey years were parcels of her might the strewings of the ways wherein she trod were the twain seasons of the day and night lo she was thus when her clear limbs enticed all lips that now grow sad with kissing christ stained with blood fallen from the feet of god the feet and hands whereat our souls were priced alas lord surely thou art great and fair but lo her wonderfully woven hair and thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss but see now lord her mouth is lovelier she is right fair what hath she done to thee nay fair lord christ lift up thine eyes and see had now thy mother such a lip like this thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me inside the horsel here the air is hot right little peace one hath for it god wot the scented dusty daylight burns the air and my heart chokes me till i hear it not behold my venus my souls body lies with my love laid upon her garment wise feeling my love in all her limbs and hair and shed between her eyelids through her eyes she holds my heart in her sweet open hands hanging asleep hard by her head there stands crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire love wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume that shift and steam loose clots of arid fume from the seas panting mouth of dry desire there stands he like one labouring at a loom the warp holds fast across and every thread that makes the woof up has dry specks of red always the shuttle cleaves clean through and he weaves with the hair of many a ruined head love is not glad nor sorry as i deem labouring he dreams and labours in the dream till when the spool is finished lo i see his web reeled off curls and goes out like steam night falls like fire the heavy lights run low and as they drop my blood and body so shake as the flame shakes full of days and hours that sleep not neither weep they as they go ah yet would god this flesh of mine might be where air might wash and long leaves cover me where tides of grass break into foam of flowers or where the winds feet shine along the sea ah yet would god that stems and roots were bred out of my weary body and my head that sleep were sealed upon me with a seal and i were as the least of all his dead would god my blood were dew to feed the grass mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass my body broken as a turning wheel and my mouth stricken ere it saith alas ah god that love were as a flower or flame that life were as the naming of a name that death were not more pitiful than desire that these things were not one thing and the same behold now surely somewhere there is death for each man hath some space of years he saith a little space of time ere time expire a little day a little way of breath and lo between the sundawn and the sun his days work and his nights work are undone and lo between the nightfall and the light he is not and none knoweth of such an one ah god that i were as all souls that be as any herb or leaf of any tree as men that toil through hours of labouring night as bones of men under the deep sharp sea outside it must be winter among men for at the gold bars of the gates again i heard all night and all the hours of it the winds wet wings and fingers drip with rain knights gather riding sharp for cold i know the ways and woods are strangled with the snow and with short song the maidens spin and sit until christs birthnight lily like arow the scent and shadow shed about me make the very soul in all my senses ache the hot hard night is fed upon my breath and sleep beholds me from afar awake alas but surely where the hills grow deep or where the wild ways of the sea are steep or in strange places somewhere there is death and on deaths face the scattered hair of sleep there lover like with lips and limbs that meet they lie they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat but me the hot and hungry days devour and in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet no fruit of theirs but fruit of my desire for her loves sake whose lips through mine respire her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire so lie we not as sleep that lies by death with heavy kisses and with happy breath not as man lies by woman when the bride laughs low for loves sake and the words he saith for she lies laughing low with love she lies and turns his kisses on her lips to sighs to sighing sound of lips unsatisfied and the sweet tears are tender with her eyes ah not as they but as the souls that were slain in the old time having found her fair who sleeping with her lips upon their eyes heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair their blood runs round the roots of time like rain she casts them forth and gathers them again with nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain her little chambers drip with flower like red her girdles and the chaplets of her head her armlets and her anklets with her feet she tramples all that winepress of the dead her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires with loves burnt out and unassuaged desires between her lips the steam of them is sweet the languor in her ears of many lyres her beds are full of perfume and sad sound her doors are made with music and barred round with sighing and with laughter and with tears with tears whereby strong souls of men are bound there is the knight adonis that was slain with flesh and blood she chains him for a chain the body and the spirit in her ears cry for her lips divide him vein by vein yea all she slayeth yea every man save me me love thy lover that must cleave to thee till the ending of the days and ways of earth the shaking of the sources of the sea me most forsaken of all souls that fell me satiated with things insatiable me for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth yea laughter kindles at the heart of hell alas thy beauty for thy mouths sweet sake my soul is bitter to me my limbs quake as water as the flesh of men that weep as their hearts vein whose heart goes nigh to break ah god that sleep with flower sweet finger tips would crush the fruit of death upon my lips ah god that death would tread the grapes of sleep and wring their juice upon me as it drips there is no change of cheer for many days but change of chimes high up in the air that sways rung by the running fingers of the wind and singing sorrows heard on hidden ways day smiteth day in twain night sundereth night and on mine eyes the dark sits as the light yea lord thou knowest i know not having sinned if heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight yea as if earth were sprinkled over me such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea each pore doth yearn and the dried blood thereof gasps by sick fits my heart swims heavily there is a feverish famine in my veins below her bosom where a crushed grape stains the white and blue there my lips caught and clove an hour since and what mark of me remains i dare not always touch her lest the kiss leave my lips charred yea lord a little bliss brief bitter bliss one hath for a great sin nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is sin is it sin whereby mens souls are thrust into the pit yet had i a good trust to save my soul before it slipped therein trod under by the fire shod feet of lust for if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath i look between the iron sides of death into sad hell where all sweet love hath end all but the pain that never finisheth there are the naked faces of great kings the singing folk with all their lute playings there when one cometh he shall have to friend the grave that covets and the worm that clings there sit the knights that were so great of hand the ladies that were queens of fair green land grown grey and black now brought unto the dust soiled without raiment clad about with sand there is one end for all of them they sit naked and sad they drink the dregs of it trodden as grapes in the wine press of lust trampled and trodden by the fiery feet i see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell cities and people whom the gods loved well yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold and for their sakes on her the fire of hell and softer than the egyptian lote leaf is the queen whose face was worth the world to kiss wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold and large pale lips of strong semiramis curled like a tigers that curl back to feed red only where the last kiss made them bleed her hair most thick with many a carven gem deep in the mane great chested like a steed yea with red sin the faces of them shine but in all these there was no sin like mine no not in all the strange great sins of them that made the wine press froth and foam with wine for i was of christs choosing i gods knight no blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light i can well see for all the dusty days gone past the clean great time of goodly fight i smell the breathing battle sharp with blows with shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows the fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways sounds and long lights are shed between the rows of beautiful mailed men the edged light slips most like a snake that takes short breath and dips sharp from the beautifully bending head with all its gracious body lithe as lips that curl in touching you right in this wise my sword doth seeming fire in mine own eyes leaving all colours in them brown and red and flecked with death then the keen breaths like sighs the caught up choked dry laughters following them when all the fighting face is grown a flame for pleasure and the pulse that stuns the ears and the hearts gladness of the goodly game let me think yet a little i do know these things were sweet but sweet such years ago their savour is all turned now into tears yea ten years since where the blue ripples blow the blue curled eddies of the blowing rhine i felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine touch my blood too and sting me with delight through all this waste and weary body of mine that never feels clear air right gladly then i rode alone a great way off my men and heard the chiming bridle smite and smite and gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again till my song shifted to that iron one seeing there rode up between me and the sun some certain of my foes men for his three white wolves across their painted coats did run the first red bearded with square cheeks alack i made my knaves blood turn his beard to black the slaying of him was a joy to see perchance too when at night he came not back some woman fell a weeping whom this thief would beat when he had drunken yet small grief hath any for the ridding of such knaves yea if one wept i doubt her teen was brief this bitter love is sorrow in all lands draining of eyelids wringing of drenched hands sighing of hearts and filling up of graves a sign across the head of the world he stands an one that hath a plague mark on his brows dust and spilt blood do track him to his house down under earth sweet smells of lip and cheek like a sweet snakes breath made more poisonous with chewing of some perfumed deadly grass are shed all round his passage if he pass and their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was as one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds and tracking ever slotwise the warm smell is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds his head far down the hot sweet throat of her so one tracks love whose breath is deadlier and lo one springe and you are fast in hell fast as the gins grip of a wayfarer i think now as the heavy hours decease one after one and bitter thoughts increase one upon one of all sweet finished things the breaking of the battle the long peace wherein we sat clothed softly each mans hair crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair the sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings and noise of singing in the late sweet air i sang of love too knowing nought thereof sweeter i said the little laugh of love than tears out of the eyes of magdalen or any fallen feather of the dove the broken little laugh that spoils a kiss the ache of purple pulses and the bliss of blinded eyelids that expand again love draws them open with those lips of his lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown of one same fire and colour with their own then ere one sleep appeased with sacrifice where his lips wounded there his lips atone i sang these things long since and knew them not lo here is love or there is love god wot this man and that finds favour in his eyes i said but i what guerdon have i got the dust of praise that is blown everywhere in all mens faces with the common air the bay leaf that wants chafing to be sweet before they wind it in a singers hair so that one dawn i rode forth sorrowing i had no hope but of some evil thing and so rode slowly past the windy wheat and past the vineyard and the water spring up to the horsel a great elder tree held back its heaps of flowers to let me see the ripe tall grass and one that walked therein naked with hair shed over to the knee she walked between the blossom and the grass i knew the beauty of her what she was the beauty of her body and her sin and in my flesh the sin of hers alas alas for sorrow is all the end of this o sad kissed mouth how sorrowful it is o breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings red with the bitter blossom of a kiss ah with blind lips i felt for you and found about my neck your hands and hair enwound the hands that stifle and the hair that stings i felt them fasten sharply without sound yea for my sin i had great store of bliss rise up make answer for me let thy kiss seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is yet i waxed faint with fume of barren bowers and murmuring of the heavy headed hours and let the doves beak fret and peck within my lips in vain and love shed fruitless flowers so that god looked upon me when your hands were hot about me yea god brake my bands to save my soul alive and i came forth like a man blind and naked in strange lands that hears men laugh and weep and knows not whence nor wherefore but is broken in his sense howbeit i met folk riding from the north towards rome to purge them of their souls offence and rode with them and spake to none the day stunned me like lights upon some wizard way and ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight so rode i hearing all these chant and pray and marvelled till before us rose and fell white cursed hills like outer skirts of hell seen where mens eyes look through the day to night like a jagged shells lips harsh untunable blown in between by devils wrangling breath nathless we won well past that hell and death down to the sweet land where all airs are good even unto rome where gods grace tarrieth then came each man and worshipped at his knees who in the lord gods likeness bears the keys to bind or loose and called on christs shed blood and so the sweet souled father gave him ease but when i came i fell down at his feet saying father though the lords blood be right sweet the spot it takes not off the panthers skin nor shall an ethiops stain be bleached with it lo i have sinned and have spat out at god wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod more sharp because of mine exceeding sin and all his raiment redder than bright blood before mine eyes yea for my sake i wot the heat of hell is waxen seven times hot through my great sin then spake he some sweet word giving me cheer which thing availed me not yea scarce i wist if such indeed were said for when i ceased lo as one newly dead who hears a great cry out of hell i heard the crying of his voice across my head until this dry shred staff that hath no whit of leaf nor bark bear blossom and smell sweet seek thou not any mercy in gods sight for so long shalt thou be cast out from it yea what if dried up stems wax red and green shall that thing be which is not nor has been yea what if sapless bark wax green and white shall any good fruit grow upon my sin nay though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree and though men drew sweet waters of the sea there should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem this waste wan body and shaken soul of me yea though god search it warily enough there is not one sound thing in all thereof though he search all my veins through searching them he shall find nothing whole therein but love for i came home right heavy with small cheer and lo my love mine own souls heart more dear than mine own soul more beautiful than god who hath my being between the hands of her fair still but fair for no man saving me as when she came out of the naked sea making the foam as fire whereon she trod and as the inner flower of fire was she yea she laid hold upon me and her mouth clove unto mine as soul to body doth and laughing made her lips luxurious her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south strange spice and flower strange savour of crushed fruit and perfume the swart kings tread underfoot for pleasure when their minds wax amorous charred frankincense and grated sandal root and i forgot fear and all weary things all ended prayers and perished thanksgivings feeling her face with all her eager hair cleave to me clinging as a fire that clings to the body and to the raiment burning them as after death i know that such like flame shall cleave to me for ever yea what care albeit i burn then having felt the same ah love there is no better life than this to have known love how bitter a thing it is and afterward be cast out of gods sight yea these that know not shall they have such bliss high up in barren heaven before his face as we twain in the heavy hearted place remembering love and all the dead delight and all that time was sweet with for a space for till the thunder in the trumpet be soul may divide from body but not we one from another i hold thee with my hand i let mine eyes have all their will of thee i seal myself upon thee with my might abiding alway out of all mens sight until god loosen over sea and land the thunder of the trumpets of the night yesterday afternoon i hung a framed print in the living room a task that took two head throbbing hours its a wedding portrait that we love frida and diego rivera i wonder how two people could consistently hurt each other but still feel love so deeply as their bones turned into dust before frida died she painted a watermelon still life before his death diego did too i want to believe that those paintings were composed during parallel moments because of their undying devotion if i close my eyes i can see melon wedges left like centerpieces except for the slice diego put on the tables corner one piece of fruit pecked at by a dove that passed through a window i know that i wont be building a bookshelf anytime soon and that the chances of me constructing a roll top desk are as slim as me building an adirondack chair that sits plumb but im good with the spackle and putty knives in my tool belt the knots in my back might not be there if i had listened to her suggestions and i could well have done without two hours of silence over a few holes in the wall but somehow life has its ways of working things out this afternoon i shut the blinds turned off the tv lights and phone and massaged my wifes feet to fight off a migraine her second one this week despite the prophylactics and pain killers that we store in the breadbox for once id like to experience what she feels nausea blindness and pain that strike when the cranial vessels dilate fill with blood leak and make the brain swell earlier an mri triggered the reaction as it mapped her head with electrical current gradient magnets and radio waves hammering her floundering eyes for now we have our room the bed frame and the mattress where she lies as i knead her toes come nightfall i hope that well sit in the patio and watch the breeze stirring the lemon lime and orange trees that i planted along the back fence on certain nights the moon turns our lawn into green acrylic where we sip syrah and mint tea until all we know is the sound of our breathing among the whispering leaves wife two was a stripper and sweet as well he traded her in for me to people i dont know i say she was a dancer i watch them puzzled wonder how anyone could not love a ballerina and you have to question a guy like that trading in a sweet stripper for me not a homemaker not home much at all not sweet more like my grandfather jimmy grieco mean my mother likes to describe the blue sky day when she bought me a helium balloon and i let it go i was six i begged for another she said okay but if you let this one go im really going to be mad i nodded took the string in my hand held tight and then opened my hand flat so the balloon lifted and its string slipped up and away you were never sweet my mother says in vegas a few weeks ago jimmy and i sorted photographs in his double wide just off boulder highway my mother stood on the sidelines she hates how i ask jimmy for the hard stories tell me about the moonshine tell me about the dead kids tell me how your mother saved the family by burning down the farm jimmys crooked finger points to a picture of the family that was leonard he was deaf and dumb died at twelve that was vincent the baby who fell off the staircase without a rail dead at two then theres his mother surrounded by her children she was tough he says tough when chicagos black hand demanded ten thousand dollars she stuffed five grand in her apron grabbed my grandfather then five and took him to deliver the money thats all youll ever get she said and dont touch my kids or ill kill you my grandfather never asks about the first or second wife i dont have to tell him that ballerina fable he knows im three and mean he knows it for his whole life his first my grandmother was like sugar he burned her abandoned her in la raced to mexico paved road turning to dirt he ate prickly pear maybe on the way to his quick divorce and though he wont tell this story his own father lived first with a sweet woman on a wheat farm far south in craco italy he boarded a ship told his wife hed send for her and then fled to new york and in an apartment on mulberry street he met up with the new girlfriend and they disappeared into their new world she wasnt pretty she was tough she got busted twice for making moonshine her sons loved her she was mean the count of cappuccino the marquise of meringue all the little cantuccini and what was the song they sang oh the best of us is nothing but a sweetening of the air a tryst between the teeth and tongue we meet and no ones there though the caf s always crowded as society arrives and light glints to and fro between the eyes and rings and knives well slip away together perfect ghosts of appetite the balancing of ash on fire and whim the mating flight of amaretti papers my petite montgolfiere our lit cage rising weightless up the lift shaft of the air so the count of cappuccino the marquise of not much more consumed each others hunger then the crash and then the war it was many and many a year ago in a kingdom by the sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of annabel lee and this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me i was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love i and my annabel lee with a love that the wing d seraphs of heaven coveted her and me and this was the reason that long ago in this kingdom by the sea a wind blew out of a cloud chilling my beautiful annabel lee so that her highborn kinsmen came and bore her away from me to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea the angels not half so happy in heaven went envying her and me yes that was the reason as all men know in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud by night chilling and killing my annabel lee but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we of many far wiser than we and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful annabel lee and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes of the beautiful annabel lee and so all the night tide i lie down by the side of my darling my darling my life and my bride in her sepulchre there by the sea in her tomb by the sounding sea there is a smile of love and there is a smile of deceit and there is a smile of smiles in which these two smiles meet and there is a frown of hate and there is a frown of disdain and there is a frown of frowns which you strive to forget in vain for it sticks in the hearts deep core and it sticks in the deep back bone and no smile that ever was smild but only one smile alone that betwixt the cradle grave it only once smild can be but when it once is smild theres an end to all misery dr alfonso barabinsky wants to go outsidei hold him down with my smaller body he walks runs from his shoes to my kitchen he is drinking in my kitchen he swims in my kitchen with his varicose fat legs alfonso you fool you think it is brave to drinkvodka all morning on an empty stomach the walls of our apartment flash the walls of our apartment stand they are bombing his hospital he washes my face he fingerspells the names of patients the shadow of his fingers huge on the whitewashed wall the walls of our apartment flash when the bombs fallwe make children he kneels and kissesthrough my skinthe shape of our only child they are bombing his office takes his glasses off and lays them on the table like a shining weapon throws his t shirt at our cat fat hangs over his belt pulls a stolen lemonout his pocket they are bombing his hospital office but i am a ripe womana man could be happy i asked myself what sappho can you give one who has everything like aphrodite how much delight before we collapse how much earth in the lungs how much wine when we want more when the weeds sprawl it is not what you think think how fast some landscapes change the lover the gardeners grand idea the failing maple the boat about to capsize the correction the hands reflection the impossible replication of weight versus time how it will never mean what you want while the doormat asks neurotic questions about his ex the dream girl looks at her watch if her man brings up the ex and if the man ever says everyone was in love with my ex a dream girl wont ask for a photo but if a photo of the ex is provided the dream girl wont demean the appearance of the ex because her man will likely rush to his exs defense the lesson is that when a man considers his ex a prize looks have little to do with it for when a woman acts like a prize a man can forget hes with a battle axe what should you say when he asks questions about your ex remember youre a prize so you neednt report that your ex stole appliances or defaulted on child support or that your ex has a mafioso brother doing time for racketeering or that your ex is still stalking you because your man will not find these ex stories charming if hes classy so what you say about your ex is simply we wanted different things or alternatively my ex and i went separate ways its none of his business your ex and all the vicissitudes of your past like the jewelry your ex gave you which you pawned or your violent fantasies about your ex because inquiring minds dont need to know did you know that exes are a common conversation topic among men you remember my ex the one who snapped they might say referring to the terrible ex who was possessed by demons thus causing the inevitable ex tramarital affair of course he never had anything to do with his exs transformation he was a perfect angel but lo and behold the ex orcist was suddenly required women believe these narratives and ex coriate themselves if theyre doormats but love is beset by variables and dream girls must take control in this world of unknowns in the back of the junkhouse stacked on a cardtable covered by a ragged bedspread they rest black platters whose music once crackled hissed with a static like shuffling feet fox trot or two step the slow dance of the needle riding its merry go round my mothers head nestled on my fathers shoulder as they turned lost in the sway of sounds summer nights and faraway places the syncopation of time waltzing them to a world they never dreamed dance of then to the dust of now farewell my dearer half joy of my heart heaven only knows how loth i am to part whole months but hours seem when you are here when absent every minute is a year might i but always see thy charming face ide live on racks and wish no easier place but we must part your interest says we must fate me no longer with such treasure trust i woud not tax you with inconstancy yet strephon you are not so kind as i no interest no nor fate it self has powr to tempt me from the idol i adore but since you needs will go may africk be kinder to you than europe is to me may all you meet and every thing you view give you such transport as i met in you may no sad thoughts disturb your quiet mind except youl think of her you left behind speak to her heart that manic force when wits depart forbids remorse dream with her dreaming until her lust seems to her seeming an act of trust do without doing loves wilful potion veils the ensuing and brief commotion she was changing on the inside it was true what had been written the new syntax of love both sucked and burned the secret clung around them she took in the smell walking down a road to nowhere every sound was relevant the sun fell behind them now he seemed strangely moved she would take her clothes off for the camera she said in plain english but she wasnt holding that snake you follow close behind me for a thousand miles responsive to my movements i signal you signal back we will meet at the next exit you blow kisses which i return you mouth i love you a message for my rearview mirror we do a slow tango as we change lanes in tandem gracefully as though music were guiding us it is tighter than bodies locked in heat this caring this ardent watching she took the spareribs out of the oven and set them steaming on a plate before leaving her apartment i didnt know how long to wait tore into cold meat when i decided my mother wasnt coming back no one knew about the gun she kept in her purse until the authorities called a caliber pistol with a pearl handle and a trigger even she could easily pull her car still waiting to be towed from a roadside ditch when they arrived on the scene yesterday morning i was leaning over a kitchen sink my husband upstairs sleeping between his snores muffled under a down comforter and a portable electric heater that kept our bedroom warm i knew i could sob as loud as i wanted without disturbing his dreams at the sports arena between musical acts and clouds of dope i texted my lover a wide angle shot of the stage the reception bars on my phone bouncing back and forth between high and low a text i had to send several times before it went through even though there was a chance his phone would be off or the text get lost for hours in the ether even days the silence is the agony my therapist says its not your fault no way for you to have known exactly where your mother was headed then why am i left weepingin my kitchen decades after the fact when i went upstairs and sat beside my husband he could feel the mattress shift beneath our weight even though i felt much lighter after watching translucent ropes of snot lowering down into the sink arms around me when i asked if he was awake knowing that he wasnt how many romances get derailed when a text that has been sent fails to go through how many mothers disappear through a kitchen door never to return the food on the table the last meal they will ever serve my lover texted back where are you now having no idea what id been going through when he texted again wish i was there with you i washed a load of clothes and hung them out to dry then i went up to town and busied myself all day the sleeve of your best shirt rose ceremonious when i drove in our night clothes twined and untwined in a little gust of wind for me it was getting late for you where you were not the harvest moon was full but sparse clouds made its light not quite reliable the bed on your side seemed as wide and flat as kansas your pillow plump cool and allegorical there is a chair the heart of which is wooden split five ways and grass pressed flat where we kissed where others later kissed on the same mattress and solemn nothing happening under a canopy have you forgotten me i will go down wonderfully as was told in proverbs though for a long time i thought i should not go here are things that have no latin names or none that men would know i enough were tired my heart and i we sit beside the headstone thus and wish that name were carved for us the moss reprints more tenderly the hard types of the masons knife as heavens sweet life renews earths life with which were tired my heart and i ii you see were tired my heart and i we dealt with books we trusted men and in our own blood drenched the pen as if such colours could not fly we walked too straight for fortunes end we loved too true to keep a friend at last were tired my heart and i iii how tired we feel my heart and i we seem of no use in the world our fancies hang grey and uncurled about mens eyes indifferently our voice which thrilled you so will let you sleep our tears are only wet what do we here my heart and i iv so tired so tired my heart and i it was not thus in that old time when ralph sat with me neath the lime to watch the sunset from the sky dear love youre looking tired he said i smiling at him shook my head tis now were tired my heart and i v so tired so tired my heart and i though now none takes me on his arm to fold me close and kiss me warm till each quick breath end in a sigh of happy languor now alone we lean upon this graveyard stone uncheered unkissed my heart and i vi tired out we are my heart and i suppose the world brought diadems to tempt us crusted with loose gems of powers and pleasures let it try we scarcely care to look at even a pretty child or gods blue heaven we feel so tired my heart and i vii yet who complains my heart and i in this abundant earth no doubt is little room for things worn out disdain them break them throw them by and if before the days grew rough we once were loved used well enough i think weve fared my heart and i lash everything irredeemable to the ficus with muscle use the flexor digitorum brevis from the arch of my right foot this is how whats grounded gets hitched to the rooted everything cramped into place and contemplative tight striations might as well be bindings to bodhi as body why not dump this tired mind at the foot of a tree aerial roots less caustic than an unanswered calling or perhaps this is it to sit to ponder to ask what violated cunt what unhappy gasp what sad spat and toppling building left us blooming untoward who puts flowers on the inside of a fig except the injured or the bereft the ones who hankered hard and failed to do anything but live lush and fallible what regret is bark or bitch the world succumbs to beauty even now in the throes the sky is dark and hidden behind branches cephalic veins clotted with grief hush now finally all the face can do is flush sympathetic nervous system visible horror of wounded and wounding all inflorescence remains safe inside that place the mind opens up pear shaped and vast the body of every lover is unattached to hurt or hope falls in its own field of daffodils to curl fetal with singular prowess or glut guy calls the doctor says the wifes contractions are five minutes apart doctor says is this her first child guy says no its her husband i promise to try to remember who i am wife gets up on one elbow says i wanted to get married it seemed a fulfillment of some several things a thing to be done even the diamond ring was some thing like a quest a thing they set you out to get and how insane the quest is how you have to turn it every way before you can even think to seek it this metaphysical refraining is in fact the quest whod have guessed she sighs i like the predictability of two i like my pleasures fully expected when the expectation of them grows patterned in its steady surprise ive got my sweet and tumble pat here on earth i like to count upon a thing like that thus explained the woman in contractions to her lover holding on the telephone for the doctor to recover from this strange conversational turn you say youre whom it is a pleasure to meet you she rolls her eyes but hed once asked her am i your first lover and shed said could be your face looks familiar its the same type of generative error the grammar of the spoken word will flip let alone the written until something new is in us and in our conversation there will be no edges but curves clean lines pointing only forward history with its hard spine dog eared corners will be replaced with nuance just like the dinosaurs gave way to mounds and mounds of ice women will still be women but the distinction will be empty sex having outlived every threat will gratify only the mind which is where it will exist for kicks well dance for ourselves before mirrors studded with golden bulbs the oldest among us will recognize that glow but the word sun will have been re assigned to the standard uranium neutralizing device found in households and nursing homes and yes well live to be much older thanks to popular consensus weightless unhinged eons from even our own moon well drift in the haze of space which will be once and for all scrutable and safe no shards where one is bound to no place in the first place all shards we were clear on that from the beginning absence is always sudden to hear your voice once more more echo than shrapnel qualia of the forbiddentransforms itself into wounds regenerates a hydra or lizard tail touch me im alive again there isnt enough time or proximityfor your essence or mine to vanishwell remain fire and ice who turn to glass that doesnt shattermercury if it shatters when we are lost in our longings aurelius already it is too late there is already nothing we can do i have rarely desired an end to my desires we are so in love with our wanting last week though doctors were quick to repair it a baby in india was born grasping her own beating heart in her fist today a dumpster arrives from daves trash removal i begin to fill it i toss in a transistor radio that hasnt worked in years a man walking past asks if he can take it later he returns carries off a broken tv a neighbor salvages the dented gray fuse box a girl wants a window a paper bag full of tangled cords all night i listen to the wind the echoes of feet kicking through rubbish like a mouse nesting inside a drum my older brother is dead a decade yet here in its enormous gold frame is the familiar pastel portrait someone named maxwell drew for our mother an inaccurate rendering of the two of us when we were small i cant look at it i cant throw it away every change is a death you tell yourself turn thy thoughts now to thy life as a child one day i tell myself i will shut all the doors leave everything behind the museum is showing a hundred tricked out victorian photographs of that other world the hoax of floating fairies women haunted by ghostly blurs another century still we want to believe in what we know cannot be true your words aurelius have found me but you could not if we are disappointed we have only ourselves to blame wipe out thy imagination we fill our hands when they are empty we empty ourselves when we have held too much too long all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred flame oft in my waking dreams do i live oer again that happy hour when midway on the mount i lay beside the ruined tower the moonshine stealing oer the scene had blended with the lights of eve and she was there my hope my joy my own dear genevieve she leant against the arm e d man the statue of the arm e d knight she stood and listened to my lay amid the lingering light few sorrows hath she of her own my hope my joy my genevieve she loves me best wheneer i sing the songs that make her grieve i played a soft and doleful air i sang an old and moving story an old rude song that suited well that ruin wild and hoary she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace for well she knew i could not choose but gaze upon her face i told her of the knight that wore upon his shield a burning brand and that for ten long years he wooed the lady of the land i told her how he pined and ah the deep the low the pleading tone with which i sang anothers love interpreted my own she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace and she forgave me that i gazed too fondly on her face but when i told the cruel scorn that crazed that bold and lovely knight and that he crossed the mountain woods nor rested day nor night that sometimes from the savage den and sometimes from the darksome shade and sometimes starting up at once in green and sunny glade there came and looked him in the face an angel beautiful and bright and that he knew it was a fiend this miserable knight and that unknowing what he did he leaped amid a murderous band and saved from outrage worse than death the lady of the land and how she wept and clasped his knees and how she tended him in vain and ever strove to expiate the scorn that crazed his brain and that she nursed him in a cave and how his madness went away when on the yellow forest leaves a dying man he lay his dying words but when i reached that tenderest strain of all the ditty my faltering voice and pausing harp disturbed her soul with pity all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled my guileless genevieve the music and the doleful tale the rich and balmy eve and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued subdued and cherished long she wept with pity and delight she blushed with love and virgin shame and like the murmur of a dream i heard her breathe my name her bosom heaved she stepped aside as conscious of my look she stepped then suddenly with timorous eye she fled to me and wept she half enclosed me with her arms she pressed me with a meek embrace and bending back her head looked up and gazed upon my face twas partly love and partly fear and partly twas a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart i calmed her fears and she was calm and told her love with virgin pride and so i won my genevieve my bright and beauteous bride go dumb born book tell her that sang me once that song of lawes hadst thou but song as thou hast subjects known then were there cause in thee that should condone even my faults that heavy upon me lie and build her glories their longevity tell her that sheds such treasure in the air recking naught else but that her graces give life to the moment i would bid them live as roses might in magic amber laid red overwrought with orange and all made one substance and one colour braving time tell her that goes with song upon her lips but sings not out the song nor knows the maker of it some other mouth may be as fair as hers might in new ages gain her worshippers when our two dusts with wallers shall be laid siftings on siftings in oblivion till change hath broken down all things save beauty alone somewhere people must still do things like fetch water from wells in buckets then pour it out for those animals that long domesticated would likely perish before figuring out how to get for themselves that dog for example whose refusal to leave my side i mistook as a child for loyalty when all along it was just blind what is it about vulnerability that can make the hand draw back sometimes and can sometimes seem the catalyst for rendering the hand into sheer force destructive dont you see how youve burnt almost all of it all the tenderness away someone screams to someone else in public and looking elsewhere we walk quickly past as if even to have heard that much might have put us at risk of whatever fate questions like that spring from estrangement like sacrifice begins as a word at first soon its the stuff of drama cue the follow up tears that attend drama then its pretty much the difference between waking up to a storm and waking up inside one who can say how she got there in the ocean i mean but i once watched a horse make her way back to land mid hurricane having ridden surfer like the very waves that at any moment could have overwhelmed her in their crash to shore she shook herself looked back once on the waters restlessness historys always restless and the horse stepped free i make a knife of words i sit here waiting i play with crumbs her eyes that should lookstraight at me aretoward the window glazed husbands horizon not armored only armedwith pots and pans not out of arms reach beyond curtains of doorbells garden gates she puts up ironworkin her eyes it draws a boltover whats real then looks at me i wish id brought my saw my love is in a light attire among the apple trees where the gay winds do most desire to run in companies there where the gay winds stay to woo the young leaves as they pass my love goes slowly bending to her shadow on the grass and where the skys a pale blue cup over the laughing land my love goes lightly holding up her dress with dainty hand i lived with visions for my company instead of men and women years ago and found them gentle mates nor thought to know a sweeter music than they played to me but soon their trailing purple was not free of this worlds dust their lutes did silent grow and i myself grew faint and blind below their vanishing eyes then thou didst come to be belov d what they seemed their shining fronts their songs their splendours better yet the same as river water hallowed into fonts met in thee and from out thee overcame my soul with satisfaction of all wants because gods gifts put mans best dreams to shame i could pick anything and think of you this lamp the wind still rain the glossy blue my pen exudes drying matte upon the page i could choose any hero any cause or age and sure as shooting arrows to the heart astride a dappled mare legs braced as far apart as standing in silver stirrups will allow there youll be with furrowed brow and chain mail glinting to set me free one eye smiling the other firm upon the enemy this post postmodern age is all business compact disks and faxes a do it now and take no risks event today a hurricane is nudging up the coast oddly male big bad floyd who brings a host of daydreams awkward reminiscences of teenage crushes on worthless boys whose only talent was to kiss you senseless they all had sissy names marcel percy dewey were thin as licorice and as chewy sweet with a dark and hollow center floyds cussing up a storm youre bunkered in your aerie im perched in mine twin desks computers hardwood floors were content but fall short of the divine still its embarrassing this happiness whos satisfied simply with whats good for us when has the ordinary ever been news and yet because nothing else will do to keep me from melancholy call it blues i fill this stolen time with you i at ten a scratchy waltz buzzed over the ice rinks p a my classmate tony the barbers son alls he wantsa do is you know like play bored with perfecting my languid figure eights i trailed him to a basement door marked gents with its metal silhouette of high laced skates symbols i guess of methods desire invents tonys older brother was waiting inside id been requested it seemed he was sixteen tall rawboned blue eyed thumbs hooked into faded tightening jeans i fumbled with small talk pretending to be shy looking past me he slowly unzipped his fly ii callas her voice steeped in a rancid syrupy phlegm whatevers not believed remains a grace while again she invokes the power that yields splintered timber and quick consuming flame the simplest way to take hold of the hearts complications its pool of spilt religion a long black hair sweat stuck to the skin the bitter sleep of the dying the jew in berlin who sent you here the sharp blade pleads stormcloud thornhedge starchill blood bubble floating to the top of the glass the light from fleshrise to soulset the world dragging the slow weight of its shame like the train of pomp guttering candle her voice iii in class parasangs satraps the daily drill beginners greek its own touchstone the sophomore teacher was father moan whom i longed to have praise my skill the illustrated readers best accounts of murder and sacrifice only suggested the heavy price i longed to pay at his behest hed slap the pointer against his thigh i quivered what coldness may construe of devotion was an experience as hard to learn as catch his eye i kept my hand up here i knew the right answer the case the tense the humid nights are best and worst best because the birds sing at two in the morning when you cannot get back into the other world worst because it is the moist heat that makes the skin supple makes you want to rub against someone else a woman and there is nothing but the long list of lost chances things you could have said perhaps the simple question of will you sleep with me so that it is not just you and this shell of a home this place where it feels the walls are another layer of my skin and that is neither best or worst it is the holding of the dead stink the memories that was over him holding them back it is the utter singleness of being the only person here the way the thoughts think themselves down to accepting that this is really just me here wondering who i am just me here wondering why i am awake at two which trigger it was knowing all the time all too well the way the war of life is connected to the nervous system of the world the ganglia of our shared horrors either mine so large or so people tell me and here it seems to be the membrane between the skin of my bones and the skin of this home the absorbing shock of space that gives when the memories burn their way in or out of me i would lie here wondering how to tell her i am wrestling with the angel wrestling with memories in the crevices and cracks of my body of how i feel right now what it felt like then in those times and i am glad she is not here and i wish she were here and she has no name because this is some woman i do not know i practice in the silence of my thoughts the different pitch and rhythm of how i might ask will you sleep with me afraid of what to say should she say yes and this decade of my monkish life should lie open and i have to say why i am sitting on the edge of the bed why i have woke her from the sweet smile i assume she has when i assume her horror is smaller than mine we sat together at one summers end that beautiful mild woman your close friend and you and i and talked of poetry i said a line will take us hours maybe yet if it does not seem a moments thought our stitching and unstitching has been naught better go down upon your marrow bones and scrub a kitchen pavement or break stones like an old pauper in all kinds of weather for to articulate sweet sounds together is to work harder than all these and yet be thought an idler by the noisy set of bankers schoolmasters and clergymen the martyrs call the world and thereupon that beautiful mild woman for whose sake theres many a one shall find out all heartache on finding that her voice is sweet and low replied to be born woman is to know although they do not talk of it at school that we must labour to be beautiful i said its certain there is no fine thing since adams fall but needs much labouring there have been lovers who thought love should be so much compounded of high courtesy that they would sigh and quote with learned looks precedents out of beautiful old books yet now it seems an idle trade enough we sat grown quiet at the name of love we saw the last embers of daylight die and in the trembling blue green of the sky a moon worn as if it had been a shell washed by times waters as they rose and fell about the stars and broke in days and years i had a thought for no ones but your ears that you were beautiful and that i strove to love you in the old high way of love that it had all seemed happy and yet wed grown as weary hearted as that hollow moon you give me flowers resembling chinese lanterns you give me hale for yellow you give me vex you give me lemons

seat i said it resolutely though not firmly i began again on paradise my voice as clean as the dewey decimal system i brought up my on paradise powerpoint visuals of forests trees he was seated once my car broke down in front of a nunnery over the door of which was inscribed from dante nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura and i thought at the time i had been thinking una selva oscura had to mean dark self never bothering to the italian i just plunged id donned a habit black robes was i saying all this out loud or in my head its hard to tell the difference if you talk enough i donned these black robes and lived in shadows and it was time for a rhetorical gesture of course of course i said with a nod a nod magnanimous a nod sagacious a nod to a slide of particularly dark trees of course the wilderness spreads woe unto him who carries the wilderness with him and the audience member i had him i knew thus i parted my robes to show marching in and out of my cunt the ants then the robes i shut he the audience was no longer standing very close goodness i chided such distance there is the torch and the only thingthat will prevent us from using itis whether or not we can allow jellyfish in the otherwisecrystalline surf it would be easyto dismiss this view as beautiful and walk awaybecause it is buggy and we forgotthe spray to cancel the

you dont dandelions and honeysucklesurround me the worlds ineluctable fireis looking right at me and i am making my stand dark days when i awaken so i slump back to the swamp of his armpit a whitfrom the arachnid he inked to the stump thats left so close to the vestige of it the danger hes a reliquary of tattooed noose to venerate the fist of a slug buried still in his butt abovea white cross for the men he didnt miss if only i could strip off the black mapi sleep against and be his liniment gloss over the explosion the mishap phantom he feels in a forearm itch he wont leave the long tale his tattoos read for me so i amend the story matilda farewell fate has doomd us to part but the prospect occasions no pang to my heart no longer is love with my reason at strife though once thou wert dearer far dearer than life as together we roamd i the passion confessd which thy beauty and virtue had raisd in my breast that the passion was mutual thou madst me believe and i thought my matilda could never deceive my matilda no false one my claims i resign thou canst not thou must not thou shalt not be mine i now scorn thee as much as i lovd thee before nor sigh when i think i shall meet thee no more though fair be thy form thou no lovers wilt find while folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind though coxcombs may flatter though ideots may prize thou art shunnd by the good and contemnd by the wise than mine what affection more fervent could be when i thought evry virtue was centerd in thee of the vows thou hast broken i will not complain for i mourn not the loss of a heart i disdain oh hadst thou but constant and amiable provd as that fancied perfection i formerly lovd nor absence nor time though supreme their controul could have dimmd the dear image then stampd on my soul how bright were the pictures untinted with shade by hopes glowing pencil on fancy pourtrayd sweet visions of bliss which i could not retain for they like thyself were deceitful and vain some other perhaps to matilda is dear some other more pleasing though not more sincere may he fix thy light passions now wavring as air then leave thee inconstant to shame and despair repent not matilda return not to me unavailing thy grief thy repentance will be in vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resumd for love once extinguishd is never relumd slow slow fresh fount keep time with my salt tears yet slower yet o faintly gentle springs list to the heavy part the music bears woe weeps out her division when she sings droop herbs and flowers fall grief in showers our beauties are not ours o i could still like melting snow upon some craggy hill drop drop drop drop since natures pride is now a withered daffodil hark how the mower damon sung with love of juliana stung while everything did seem to paint the scene more fit for his complaint like her fair eyes the day was fair but scorching like his amrous care sharp like his scythe his sorrow was and withered like his hopes the grass oh what unusual heats are here which thus our sunburned meadows sear the grasshopper its pipe gives oer and hamstringed frogs can dance no more but in the brook the green frog wades and grasshoppers seek out the shades only the snake that kept within now glitters in its second skin this heat the sun could never raise nor dog star so inflame the days it from an higher beauty growth which burns the fields and mower both which mads the dog and makes the sun hotter than his own pha ton not july causeth these extremes but julianas scorching beams tell me where i may pass the fires of the hot day or hot desires to what cool cave shall i descend or to what gelid fountain bend alas i look for ease in vain when remedies themselves complain no moisture but my tears do rest nor cold but in her icy breast how long wilt thou fair shepherdess esteem me and my presents less to thee the harmless snake i bring disarm d of its teeth and sting to thee chameleons changing hue and oak leaves tipped with honey dew yet thou ungrateful hast not sought nor what they are nor who them brought i am the mower damon known through all the meadows i have mown on me the morn her dew distills before her darling daffodils and if at noon my toil me heat the sun himself licks off my sweat while going home the evening sweet in cowslip water bathes my feet what though the piping shepherd stock the plains with an unnumbered flock this scythe of mine discovers wide more ground than all his sheep do hide with this the golden fleece i shear of all these closes every year and though in wool more poor than they yet am i richer far in hay nor am i so deformed to sight if in my scythe i look d right in which i see my picture done as in a crescent moon the sun the deathless fairies take me oft to lead them in their dances soft and when i tune myself to sing about me they contract their ring how happy might i still have mowed had not love here his thistles sowed but now i all the day complain joining my labour to my pain and with my scythe cut down the grass yet still my grief is where it was but when the iron blunter grows sighing i whet my scythe and woes while thus he threw his elbow round depopulating all the ground and with his whistling scythe does cut each stroke between the earth and root the edg d steel by careless chance did into his own ankle glance and there among the grass fell down by his own scythe the mower mown alas said he these hurts are slight to those that die by loves despite with shepherds purse and clowns all heal the blood i staunch and wound i seal only for him no cure is found whom julianas eyes do wound tis death alone that this must do for death thou art a mower too up early trying to muffle the sounds of small tasks grinding pouring riffling through yesterdays attacks or market slump then changing my mind what matter the rush to the waiting room or the ring of some later dubious excuse having decided to return to bed and finding you curled in the sheet a dream fluttering your eyelids still unfallen still asleep i thought of the old pilgrim when among the fixed stars in paradise he sees adam suddenly the first man there in a flame that hides his body and when it moves to speak what is inside seems not free not happy but huge and weak like an animal in a sack who had captured him what did he want to say i lay down beside you again not knowing if id stay not knowing where id been i knew too that through them i knew too that he was through i knew too that he threw them i knew too that they were through i knew too i knew too i knew i knew them i knew to them if they tear a hunter through if they tear through a hunter if they tear through a hunt and a hunter if they tear through different sizes of the six the different sizes of the six which are these a woman with a white package under one arm and a black package under the other arm and dressed in brown with a white blouse the second saint joseph the third a hunter in a blue coat and black garters and a plaid cap a fourth a knife grinder who is full faced and a very little woman with black hair and a yellow hat and an excellently smiling appropriate soldier all these as you please in the meantime examples of the same lily in this way please have you rung what do i see a very little snail a medium sized turkey a small band of sheep a fair orange tree all nice wives are like that listen to them from here oh you did not have an answer here yes a very valentine very fine is my valentine very fine and very mine very mine is my valentine very mine and very fine very fine is my valentine and mine very fine very mine and mine is my valentine why do you feel differently why do you feel differently about a very little snail and a big one why do you feel differently about a medium sized turkey and a very large one why do you feel differently about a small band of sheep and several sheep that are riding why do you feel differently about a fair orange tree and one that has blossoms as well oh very well all nice wives are like that to be no please to be they can please not to be do they please not to be do they not please yes please do they please no please do they not please no please do they please please if you please and if you please and if they please and they please to be pleased not to be pleased not to be displeased to be pleased and to please kneeling one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten the tenth is a little one kneeling and giving away a rooster with this feeling i have mentioned one four five seven eight and nine two is also giving away an animal three is changed as to disposition six is in question if we mean mother and daughter black and black caught her and she offers to be three she offers it to me that is very right and should come out below and just so bundles for them a history of giving bundles we are able to notice that each one in a way carried a bundle they were not a trouble to them nor were they all bundles as some of them were chickens some of them pheasants some of them sheep and some of them bundles they were not a trouble to them and then indeed we learned that it was the principal recreation and they were so arranged that they were not given away and to day they were given away i will not look at them again they will not look for them again they have not seen them here again they are in there and we hear them again in which way are stars brighter than they are when we have come to this decision we mention many thousands of buds and when i close my eyes i see them if you hear her snore it is not before you love her you love her so that to be her beau is very lovely she is sweetly there and her curly hair is very lovely she is sweetly here and i am very near and that is very lovely she is my tender sweet and her little feet are stretched out well which is a treat and very lovely her little tender nose is between her little eyes which close and are very lovely she is very lovely and mine which is very lovely on her way if you can see why she feel that she kneels if you can see why he knows that he shows what he bestows if you can see why they share what they share need we question that there is no doubt that by this time if they had intended to come they would have sent some notice of such intention she and they and indeed the decision itself is not early dissatisfaction in this way keys please it is useless to alarm any one it is useless to alarm some one it is useless to be alarming and to get fertility in gardens in salads in heliotrope and in dishes dishes and wishes are mentioned and dishes and wishes are not capable of darkness we like sheep and so does he let us describe let us describe how they went it was a very windy night and the road although in excellent condition and extremely well graded has many turnings and although the curves are not sharp the rise is considerable it was a very windy night and some of the larger vehicles found it more prudent not to venture in consequence some of those who had planned to go were unable to do so many others did go and there was a sacrifice of what shall we a sheep a hen a cock a village a ruin and all that and then that having been blessed let us bless it i went to my mothers room at past midnight and told her i was dying id wet the bed id had this crazy dream about a sexy neighbor id been spying on well i didnt tell her that i mean the day before she asked who i was eyeing when i didnt want to go outside for ice cream the truck was parked out front and she was buying but i couldnt join the other screaming kids not with lance applying suntan lotion to his muscled teenage skin stretched out on a beach towel in his front yard his body mystified me while mine seemed happy to defy me my dick would tent my cut offs at the sight of him i wore two pair of underwear but even then i thought id burst right through the seams so i didnt dare tell mother what id dreamed though she did think to ask me id have been a fool to tell her that she thought my blush was any boys puzzling out his sexuality but i swear it was as much because the fantasies were always other boys some from my baseball team some the roughnecks at school but usually lance he was flying naked in the dream i had that night the one that made me think that god was mad and killing me i was lying also naked and hard as cinder block on the beach towel id seen him lay across the grass the day before i tried to understand the signs implying i might turn into some kind of freaky thing but it would have been cruel to tell my mother that especially when she was already crying and trying not to laugh at the same time when i showed her what came out of me she apologized for throwing such a scene said i was growing up to be a man thats all it meant said it was normal for a boy my ages thing to start uprising like a metal beam she apologized again that i didnt have my dad around to train an year old boy in the ways of puberty i was as stupefied as ive ever been she never mentioned him and i have never turned a deeper red than i did then at past midnight when my mother helped me change my sheets and said the next day shed teach me to wash them and then she said shed ask the man across the street to talk to me would that be okay or would i feel more comfortable with someone younger like his son dorinda when death shall part us from these kids and shut up our divided lids tell me thyrsis prithee do whither thou and i must go thyrsis to the elysium dorinda oh where ist thyrsis a chaste soul can never misst dorinda i know no way but to our home is our cell elysium thyrsis turn thine eye to yonder sky there the milky way doth lie tis a sure but rugged way that leads to everlasting day

elysium thyrsis then ill go on there sheep are full of sweetest grass and softest wool there birds sing consorts garlands grow cool winds do whisper springs do flow there always is a rising sun and

them steep in wine and drink ont even till we weep so shall we smoothly pass away in sleep we walk by the sea shore holding firmly in our hands the two ends of an antique dialogue do you love me i love you with furrowed eyebrows i summarize all wisdom of the two testaments astrologers prophets philosophers of the gardens and cloistered philosophers and it sounds about like this dont cry be brave look how everybody you pout your lips and say you should be a clergyman and fed up you walk off nobody loves moralists what should i say on the shore of a small dead sea slowly the water fills the shapes of feet which have vanished i might have married a painter therefore his mother a radar detector a snow covered mountain a novel by john grisham not even out yet no i wed the cop directing my rush toot toot a trainer to test agility a kettle calling time to steep yes but i married this bird you must close your eyes to know at scale to hear his trills and fancy arpeggios come come hithering his note of warning someone once told me that animals are people under spells and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted i recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan i watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours watched her peck bugs from her breast i was sure she would make a beautiful bride but she was always a black trumpeter swan i once brushed a horses hair for straight years until it crumpled into death the truth is there is no such thing as spells the world is always as it is and always as it seems and love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood the column of the commander yielded to our first sweep even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall of the generals tomb without knowing it so we began his armies retook nubia libya and the levant lost under the sway bellied lantern jawed sun king overseer of all scribes overseer of the priests of horus grain giver to all lands royal chief of staff regent the general had himself carried on his palanquin through the wailing processions to oversee the work on this place and so carved thus one of his men punches a nubian in the face the general was low born

valley where the designs remained uncarved sketching idea along stone he does not rest either the fine picklock hand got past anubis and the reared serpents and got to him the lord of upper and lower

his own century architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations so coleridge who was indisposed that day prudently remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off on their walk through the countryside he followed them in his mind that way no one would have to dismantle horehebs outer court to secure bricks for the statuary room and facing stones he cast his mind outward a net over his dear ones sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples hill lines and the murder of lambs mother by his sister a brief madness thus through the appropriately middle distance where such things are built and performed in fact no closer no farther then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse evening in the bath of waning fire one bird stitching the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem though he was not there he could tell them that none the less he was next to his words and his word was with them even unto the rim of their wandering and their turning back one dome of air and fire but he was not there nor i here what removes the heart from what moves it as if i were the lecturer before a congress of doctors his clinching point approaching when suddenly he stared out in silence and at last said ladies and gentlemen esteemed colleagues the only thing i can see at this moment inside my brain such as it is is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball their laughter recovered him but hed found he was not there and nietzsche smooched the dray horse soon too he was not there or rather in five places seeking cartage and thinking hed found it what removal does not pass through the rippling pump room the g i whose father had been raised in a swiss house along one of the lakes knocked in uniform and asked to see it and conned the dark paneled ceilings and drank schnapps and took photos of the owners and then he knew he was not there where is the room if it always surrounds

gaze at his crouched from long enough then it will move at ease on the generals head and fish like hands floats the djed column its foliate abundance leafed powers stemming out to the bud he rises beneath it and there is no strain on his face valves of space intervene between the stone and his palms its basal flare like a parasol shelters him who under any other circumstances in that spot would be red gristle twelve tons but chiseled at the requisite depth he goes in beneath it and rises light with him and hes not there nor are you there finisher still here and breathing me though steadily you intimate such but paradox is your forte you whose touch lifted this very weight for awhile pass fluttering interpreter of the last things in our tawdry updrafts of the fake the last first butterfly my brothers maintain that the hot wind is friend lifter of stones trembler of heavy horizons for they half remember that for them you vanished into ripples at the join of sky and dust until the column floats only because ther are no longer aware that they stagger beneath it and i with them though i am not here having been grazed by your wing its razory mercy if faith is a tree that sorrow grows and women repentant or not are swamps a man who comes for solace here will be up to his knees and slow getting out a name can turn on anyone but say that a woman washes the dust from a strangers feet and sits quite dry eyed in front of her mirror at night the candle flame moves with her breath as does the hand of the painter who sees in the flame his chance for virtuosity she lets

fictive trees harsh the billow of my cape all kind of lovers crashed rubbernecking the fishes on the frontispiece were draped in your leafy worded velocity you whisper london has no more fog for me to whit my darksome peachpit storms above a buckler to them that walks uprightly will not enforce this porno hand from glove or diminish one jott my vegetable love but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again now whilst thy may hath filled thy lap with flowers now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain now use the summer smiles ere winter lowers and whilst thou spreadst unto the rising sun the fairest flower that ever saw the light now joy thy time before thy sweet be done and delia think thy morning must have night and that thy brightness sets at length to west when thou wilt close up that which now thou shewst and think the same becomes thy fading best which then shall most inveil and shadow most men do not weigh the stalk for what it was when once they find her flower her glory pass i look at my hands in a dark hour they are my wife another life fawnal explicitly made i compare responsibility to journey they are pitch black whirling in the outside world left behind like a native possessed we are older toil is our long way back home it works causes the space to beat like a heart it is a part of the poem that appears and appears on its own it goes on on its own mystical as evil but it is called freedom im sorry i was telling you about my hands how well we are married it follows i recognize all truth as some part of ten spirit is my thumb passionately without thumb i would be nothing i have met some who believe in reason they have had too much wine confess cause and effect it has been painful i told you it is unreasonable i guess i should say here i am your carpenter ethnically dark wood is my life i could show you my story better sanding then where i speak you would hear africa africa one more thing my love i have discovered in this dark wood a skill you have called our loneliness i sand it down for you until our bodies fall off im used to the emperors bitterness i cant find the sweet place unless you make me this face that is not my face i may look made but when you touch me you make me make the oak say blossom the stripped say swell the avenue pavement say river make me this shirt i cant take off the one the nights without you gathered to make me the new day the sweet place tomorrow whispering from tonights last light make me kissing you without authorization if you want me to stop youll have to make me the ruined city or is it a woman interrupting your sleep to say now to say make me and sex once a day a week a month a year goes by and one hyacinth only returns frail blue against the militant grass that does cover all in the residential precinct of the new england town its roads long paved old indian trails the steps they took toward us the first exchange for a fish two biscuits the big front wall that blocks off the courtyard often catches the newborn light of the sun like the side of a barn the body awakes in the morning to a room messy and empty that smells of the first clumsy perfume even that body wrapped now in sheets is the same that it was when it thrilled in discovery her body wakes alone to the extended call of morning the languor of another morning returning in the heavy shadows the barn of childhood and the heavy tiredness of sun hot in the indolent doorways a perfume worked itself into the usual sweat of her hair a smell the animals knew her body took secret pleasure in the suns suggestive serene caress like a real touch the languor of bed saps the sprawled limbs still youthful and plump like a childs the clumsy child used to smell the mixed scent of tobacco and hay used to tremble when touched by the mans quick hands she liked playing games sometimes she played lying down with the man in the hay but he wasnt smelling her hair hed find her closed legs in the hay and pry them open then crush her like he was her father the perfume was flowers ground upon stones it often returns in the slow rise from sleep that undone aroma of far off flowers of barns and of sun no man can know the subtle caress of that sour memory no man can see beyond that sprawled body that childhood passed in such clumsy anxiety lying asleep between the strokes of night i saw my love lean over my sad bed pale as the duskiest lilys leaf or head smooth skinned and dark with bare throat made to bite too wan for blushing and too warm for white but perfect coloured without white or red and her lips opened amorously and said i wist not what saving one word delight and all her face was honey to my mouth and all her body pasture to mine eyes the long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire the quivering flanks hair smelling of the south the bright light feet the splendid supple thighs and glittering eyelids of my souls desire aluminum sky only november leaks into early frost like a ruptured jug of gas id rather hold onto this road with pliers than have another face of you frisk my heart cool hands the touch of every moon is crucial and incomplete as a sponge bath leaving a backbone of lights behind me a blinking string of pelts in fox country i long to slice through connecticuts middle marbled and pink as medium rare beef i dream you when your man comes home from prison when he comes back like the wound and you are the stitch when he comes back with pennies in his pocket and prayer fresh on his lips you got to wash him down first you got to have the wildweed and treebark boiled and calmed waiting for his skin like a shining baptism back into what he was before gun barrels and bars chewed their claim in his hide and spit him stumbling backwards into screaming sunlight you got to scrub loose the jailtime fingersmears from ashy skin lather down the cuffmarks from ankle and wrist rinse solitarys stench loose from his hair scrape curse and confession from the welted and the smooth the hard and the soft the furrowed and the lax you got to hold tight that shadrachs face between your palms take crease and lid and lip and brow and rinse slow with river water and when he opens his eyes you tell him calm and sure how a woman birthed him back whole again i on my horse and love on me doth try our horsemanships while by strange work i prove a horseman to my horse a horse to love and now mans wrongs in me poor beast descry the reins wherewith my rider doth me tie are humbled thoughts which bit of reverence move curbed in with fear but with gilt boss above of hope which makes it seem fair to the eye the wand is will thou fancy saddle art girt fast by memory and while i spur my horse he spurs with sharp desire to my heart he sits me fast however i do stir and now hath made me to his hand so right that in the manage myself takes delight it is not that i love you less than when before your feet i lay but to prevent the sad increase of hopeless love i keep away in vain alas for everything which i have known belong to you your form does to my fancy bring and makes my old wounds bleed anew who in the spring from the new sun already has a fever got too late begins those shafts to shun which ph bus through his veins has shot too late he would the pain assuage and to thick shadows does retire about with him he bears the rage and in his tainted blood the fire but vowd i have and never must your banishd servant trouble you for if i break you may distrust the vow i made to love you too the night the world was going to end when we heard those explosions not far away and the loudspeakers telling us about the vast fires on the backwater consuming undisclosed remnants and warning us over and over to stay indoors and make no signals you stood at the open window the light of one candle back in the room we put on high boots to be ready for wherever we might have to go and we got out the oysters and sat at the small table feeding them to each other first with the fork then from our mouths to each other until there were none and we stood up and started to dance without music slowly we danced around and around in circles and after a while we hummed when the world was about to end all those years all those nights ago the lad came to the door at night when lovers crown their vows and whistled soft and out of sight in shadow of the boughs i shall not vex you with my face henceforth my love for aye so take me in your arms a space before the east is grey when i from hence away am past i shall not find a bride and you shall be the first and last i ever lay beside she heard and went and knew not why her heart to his she laid light was the air beneath the sky but dark under the shade oh do you breathe lad that your breast seems not to rise and fall and here upon my bosom prest there beats no heart at all oh loud my girl it once would knock you should have felt it then but since for you i stopped the clock it never goes again oh lad what is it lad that drips wet from your neck on mine what is it falling on my lips my lad that tastes of brine oh like enough tis blood my dear for when the knife has slit the throat across from ear to ear twill bleed because of it there is a strong wall about me to protect me it is built of the words you have said to me there are swords about me to keep me safe they are the kisses of your lips before me goes a shield to guard me from harm it is the shadow of your arms between me and danger all the wishes of my mind know your name and the white desires of my heart they are acquainted with you the cry of my body for completeness that is a cry to you my blood beats out your name to me unceasing pitiless your name your name forever is the saddest word the poems not worth it id like to read to you what andy warhol said about the traps of the rich but my tastes are changing this is a love note to a fire island lifeguard tuscano shearling and mauve champagne i should never talk even after two sips though thats when i can i hate the george v hotel but i would take you there then walk to the open market some thoughts are not that great the internet is my home where its easy to be beautiful and seen and new in the glow in the spell i thought i was better i guess i wont ever be god wants us to make out cause im in this airport where nobodys important i just wrote a letter explaining all of this to you in my head the prism refracts but the stone is cloudy all that comes through are the deeper obsessions arvid nordquist and dry shampoo cocaine and pellegrino this weather should have an entry in a lovers discourse a fully enclosed private garden with direct access to the pool hardwood floors perfect light i like crave you doesnt it ever just make you sad plans you had with different people and how it all cant come true i want the extremes of pleasure boredom watching my lovers cry i really want to show something to the lifeguard from fire island thoughts like nectar international cities to stand here a young prince unique in spirit replete with hospitality arent you even curious to see my hotel room after i swim sitting on my bed i typed principal dancer into youtube and drank to see the discourse and the honor feels good standing at my window what i think i will miss most when i die is color and the light sometimes it just comes to you amidst occasional instances of radiance or darkness i mean everyone has their shit then enough time goes by thats your life maybe i expect too much i wouldnt know how not to in my room with these portraits in gold frames feels like theater mgm pictures the bronze light of hollywood the future isnt real i should walk in golden rays past rows of motorcycles to coney island because i know grace is more real than love it feels so real in the morning on fifth ave with the lifeguard from fire island weightless in badinage whatever comes from art and life being can be too easy and common like soda i let him come inside my world because they gave me a key to gramercy park maybe tonight ill have a breakdown sometimes i use this french product to soften the water when i soak in the bathtub it is silent there like a tomb sometimes i wish i was already in mine sometimes i wish the world had a face i could touch the cheek of when i feel i could be a part of it when i cannot and i lie in the hot water sometimes i wish the pearlescent steam could sublimate the malaise and the lassitude that is there inside of me maybe it does i believe it is that way when the light touches down upon bunny lawns of fifth ave i dont care at all about the lifeguard so much gravlax or paris i should call this friend in los angeles an aesthete who hosts parties by the pool through your lens the sequoia swallowed me like a dryad the camera flashed forgot i on the other hand must practice my absent mindedness memory being awkward as a touch that goes unloved lately your eyes have shut down to a shade more durable than skins i know you love distance how it smooths you choose an aerial view the city angled to abstraction while i go for the close exposures poorly mounted countenances along broadway the pigweed cracking each hardscrabble backlot its a matter of perspective yours is to love me from a block away mine is to praise the grain iness that weaves expressively your face the moon has left the sky love the stars are hiding now and frowning on the world love night bares her sable brow the snow is on the ground love and cold and keen the air is im singing here to you love youre dreaming there in paris but this is natures law love though just it may not seem that men should wake to sing love while maidens sleep and dream them care may not molest love nor stir them from their slumbers though midnight find the swain love still halting oer his numbers i watch the rosy dawn love come stealing up the east while all things round rejoice love that night her reign has ceased the lark will soon be heard love and on his way be winging when natures poets wake love why should a man be singing i the earth and its foregoing this could be horizon combined the radicals pressed into one another what do we represent lying held in men and arms to erect gold and sun and legs running i call you disc sun entangled in the branches of a tree rice field over struggle earth over self effacement your mouth is a carriage and the carriage plus the tenth of a cubit is turn bent knuckle revolving around a pivot common is the object beneath the bench plant covers knife a weed extended to mean govern the flame in the middle of the lamp is the man with ample arms blend and pace in the midst of court your torso sings garden composes ii mastery of weeds extends to mean plants bending to cover the middle of lamp a knife for a flame foregoing the earth this is the horizon of a man with arms to move across your body i am the carriage and the cubit the disc running tangled in the branches of a tree i am the common object beneath the bench the wheel running length of the rutted road down to the garden of abdomen i struggle over fields to kiss a mouth filled with rice to put away evil this is earth over self iii beneath a table of common struggles i blend and pace in ample arms a rice field foregoing garden on the horizon of your belly govern the revolving cubit the bent knuckle me over you over self a tree earth entangled in the branches of a knife plant and cover inside your mouth the turning disc the carriage and wheel to erect lamps in the bend of your gold leg running is to extend the word to mean master garden or weed no eye that sees could fail to remark you like any leaf the rain leaves fixed to and flat against the barns gray shingle but what leaf this time of year is so pale the pale of leaves when theyve lost just enough green to become the green that means loss and more loss approaching give up the flesh enough times and whatever is lost gets forgotten that was the thought that i woke to those words in my head i rose i did not dress i left no particular body sleeping and stepping into the hour i saw you strange sign at once transparent and impossible to entirely see through and how still the still of being unmoved and then the still of no longer being able to be moved if i think of a heart his as ive found it if i think of increasingly my own if i look at you now as from above and see the diva when she is caught in mid triumph arms half raised the body as if set at last free of the green sheath that has how many nights held her it is not without remembering another i once saw like you except that something a bird some wild and necessary hunger had gotten to it and like the diva but now broken splayed and torn the green torn piecemeal from her i remember the hands and how small they seemed bringing the small ripped thing to me as a hoodoo voodoo get you back to me tool this hanks thankless task is vast a head down to the ground impossibility possibly since what im thinking of is your toe pad pinknesses too your soup hots and round and rounds the fine and perfect poundage of you on my paws the very cause and problem i moan and bemoan the absence of for love above the head this reddish coil once lavishly wore theres an air so far away its sad for me to even think the same suns rays play where it was and do to you what i would do if i were there or you were here still some thrills remembered do resemble thrills one hopes and the ropes of it that gently fell around me bound me so well no hell of miles can defile this dream i dream i mean the anyway dna i can find of you i mean the home of bones and blood that holds the whole of you and which this fizzed up missive means to conjure missy my world in a curl girl this man oh man half man i am when youre gone i want a red dress i want it flimsy and cheap i want it too tight i want to wear it until someone tears it off me i want it sleeveless and backless this dress so no one has to guess whats underneath i want to walk down the street past thriftys and the hardware store with all those keys glittering in the window past mr and mrs wong selling day old donuts in their caf past the guerra brothers slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders i want to walk like im the only woman on earth and i can have my pick i want that red dress bad i want it to confirm your worst fears about me to show you how little i care about you or anything except what i want when i find it ill pull that garment from its hanger like im choosing a body to carry me into this world through the birth cries and the love cries too and ill wear it like bones like skin itll be the goddamned dress they bury me in i here is a place where declarations are made where the heart takes precedence the gleam goes bland this is the heart part intense improvisation on the i thou axis pity the poor actors darlings dust in their throats choking dialogue ancient concentrated chatter dictated by clouds click of whispers dammed up phrases mythologizing always moans move through their limbs like wind through trees talking mad talk cross the illuminated avenues of hard cities ii take the skin take off the skin remove the vital organs one by one especially the heart what is left the skeleton the skeleton is made of calcium magnesium phosphorous et cetera an amazing catalogue of chemicals you are holding in your arms an amazing catalogue of chemicals the elements clash tenderly sparking compounds that move like eels under touch iii dime falls your voice rises fevered its keen the way the wind whips this garbage up and around like a father swinging his baby we are holding hands and yes giggling no force can stop us now we are singing all the james brown songs we know helpess off key but exhilarated columbus avenue breakdown how the puddles in the sidewalks radiate splendor glass broken against high rise buildings beckon we are hungry the shifting children salsa and you may be our feast please linger you offer me your laughter i take the sweat from y our cheeks and hum iv taste like tears sea flaked and heated taste like try again and get nowhere maybe this is the sonnet that mimes itself sequences silent and perceptive the might have saids the stomach eating rage the power of conversation is in its possibilities of interpretation heres where the mime becomes important because the words sound so dumb and heres where the anxiety dance gets choreographed it goes like this you turn clockwise i turn counter clockwise we stop stumble resolve our steps begin again v you slipped into something dangerous after attending to your intimate conferences thirsty friends forever requesting water or is it blood they want your blood somebodys screaming is it me here on the side street being a sideshow for passersby you put on your silver armor i have only my quaint devotion it is not enough you say i cant eat your food baby but i sitll like your cooking did i trip did you that mingus record is still revolving you smile serenely i can barely breathe vi if i could waste myself id do it here in public curse your name till my tongue bled the same tongue that searched out the darkest spot on your back and licked it like chocolate curse your name like you were some broken god in need of further profaning but i am no good at playing victim sadness is so private these tears on the uptown express take that tired song off the constant stereo it keeps reminding me that what brought me to you was music you said you never lied to me fucker you take the exit sign home with you but i wont become invisible you are young and i am older you are hopeful i am not enjoy life ere it grow colder pluck the roses ere they rot teach your beau to heed the lay that sunshine soon is lost in shade that nows as good as any day to take thee rosa ere she fade can these movements which move themselves be the substance of my attraction where does this thin green silk come from that covers my body surely any woman wearing such fabrics would move her body just to feel them touching every part of her yet most of the women frown or look away or laugh stiffly they are afraid of these materials and these movements in some way the psychologists would say they are afraid of themselves somehow perhaps awakening too much desire that their men could never satisfy so they keep themselves laced and buttoned and made up in hopes that the framework will keep them stiff enough not to feel the whole register in hopes that they will not have to experience that unquenchable desire for rhythm and contact if a snake glided across this floor most of them would faint or shrink away yet that movement could be their own that smooth movement frightens them awakening ancestors and relatives to the tips of the arms and toes so my bare feet and my thin green silks my bells and finger cymbals offend them frighten their old young bodies while the men simper and leer glad for the vicarious experience and exercise they do not realize how i scorn them or how i dance for their frightened unawakened sweet women but how choose the appropriate sticking point to start at who wants to write a poem without the letter e especially for thee where the flourished vowel lends such panache to your carnet de bal ok peons pizzazz to your dance card the alphabets such a hornof plenty why cork up its treasure it hurts to think of you reduced to uin stingy text messages as if ideally expression should be limited to formulas like x y where the respectable truth of tautology leaves ambiguous beauty standing bywaiting to take off her clothes if that is her percentage of body fatpermits it a statement implicitly unfair as if beauty to remain sublime had to keep uplineaments already shaped by uninhibited divinity implying as well fixated onlookers i e men and women kidding themselves that full front and back nudity is the northstar of delight rather than imagined nakedness shudderingly draped like a fully rigged fully laden ship without a drop to bail its hidden cargoes guessed at perhaps samian wine mad making or fresh basilgently crushed by its own slight weight reviving memories of delights once stumbled on as a boy delights often wreathed with necessary pain like the stout unforgiving thornsthat tear shirt and skin as we stretch for ripe blackberries to be gulped down fast sweeter than butter and marmalade quenching our thirst better than sucked ice making us almost drunk as we shriek with false contempt at each benighted umpwho decides against our teams what happened to those blissful fruits honeydew purple plum white raspberry for stealing which from mrs grossmans stand i invented ingenious alibisthat she never believed insulting or what where are childhoods innocent sweetnesses like homemade ricepudding and mince pie or the delicious resistances of various foods bonylobsters chops with their succulent tiny interstices corn sticking to the cob or the grilled feastof brook trout i caught without too much fuss after kicking a resentful hornetsnest and when carnality replaced appetite i was communally pronounced the horniestten year old around and i hadnt even seen you but when i did you became the plumein the horses hat of my lust i was thirteen when we first danced together there werent many aftersbut i cherish my plume there werent any afters nothing just a gentle abseil icould not climb back up i still wave my plume or my horse does as he canters noblyinto next year my eighty fifth i hasten to add that this coyness lady were no crime if i didnt in spite of all feel so grateful to you all manner of mercisfill my throat along with immortal memories of which i must acknowledge the thorniestto be your disappearance whether you tanked in river water or were scorched by zeuss proximity or some such baloney but your firm breasts taut nipples and bent thighs no thorns all you wanted was a loosened peplum so i still bear your plume and your name will not die not to be written here or read but my voice shall sibilateit so shrilly that unseeded babies hear me and every hidden woodworm wake from its dream to fall forever from the rafters where true love burns desire is loves pure flame it is the reflex of our earthly frame that takes its meaning from the nobler part and but translates the language of the heart and the black water under the boats with their poolsof bilge rainbowed out like rindsof steak fat the salt thickin my nostrils but pleasant too detailsi still remember from bishops poem everythingelse about it lost at the docks i watched my friend slipin her rubber boots the wide wet planks glossy with mosses you must walkduckfooted to get to the boats the black and orangefishing barrels the air with its tang of rusted metals there are always hooksand anchors to be found nets and scrapingsof wood planed by chisel the waymy great grandmother was saidto have worked employed as a shipwrighton the citys waterways in the s accordingto the newspaper clipping my grandmother photocopies for me each christmas the description of her gunmetal hairand slim torso clad in overalls the handsshe held out for the times reporter callused he noted strong as a mans does not recall the womani remember for her farm in bothellbefore it became a seattle suburb helping me gatherraspberries from the long canes she planted by her porch we spent an afternoontogether sweating in the same long sleevedcheckered shirts shed sewn us accordingto the photo i no longer have and cannot rememberwhether is the source or confirmationof this memory only the papery gray greenstreaks of road dust on the canes a bowlof chipped porcelain inside of whichwere raspberries very red very sweet furredlike my friends upper lip i rememberbetween my teeth as we stoodon the docks the smellof iron and winter mist her mouthlike nothing i have tasted since why dost thou shade thy lovely face o why does that eclipsing hand of thine deny the sunshine of the suns enlivening eye without thy light what light remains in me thou art my life my way my lights in thee i live i move and by thy beams i see thou art my life if thou but turn away my lifes a thousand deaths thou art my way without thee love i travel not but stray my light thou art without thy glorious sight my eyes are darkend with eternal night my love thou art my way my life my light thou art my way i wander if thou fly thou art my light if hid how blind am i thou art my life if thou withdrawst i die my eyes are dark and blind i cannot see to whom or whither should my darkness flee but to that light and whos that light but thee if i have lost my path dear lover say shall i still wander in a doubtful way love shall a lamb of israels sheepfold stray my path is lost my wandering steps do stray i cannot go nor can i safely stay whom should i seek but thee my path my way and yet thou turnst thy face away and flyst me and yet i sue for grace and thou denyst me speak art thou angry love or only tryst me thou art the pilgrims path the blind mans eye the dead mans life on thee my hopes rely if i but them remove i surely die dissolve thy sunbeams close thy wings and stay see see how i am blind and dead and stray o thou art my life my light my way then work thy will if passion bid me flee my reason shall obey my wings shall be stretchd out no farther than from me to thee pale hands i loved beside the shalimar where are you now who lies beneath your spell whom do you lead on raptures roadway far before you agonise them in farewell oh pale dispensers of my joys and pains holding the doors of heaven and of hell how the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins beneath your touch until you waved farewell pale hands pink tipped like lotus buds that float on those cool waters where we used to dwell i would have rather felt you round my throat crushing out life than waving me farewell tom will you let me love you in your restaurant i will let you make me a sandwich of your invention and i will eat it and call it a carolyn sandwich then you will kiss my lips and taste the mayon naise and that is how you shall love me in my restaurant tom will you come to my empty beige apartment and help me set up my daybed yes and i will put the screws in loosely so that when we move on it later it will rock like a cradle and then you will know you are my baby tom i am sitting on my dirt bike on the deck will you come out from the kitchen and watch the people with me yes and then we will race to your bedroom i will win and we will tangle up on your comforter while the sweat rains from our stomachs and fore heads tom the stars are sitting in tonight like gumball gems in a little girls jewelry box later can we walk to the duck pond yes and we can even go the long way past the jungle gym i will push you on the swing but promise me youll hold tight if you fall i might disappear tom can we make a baby together i want to be a big pregnant woman with a loved face and give you a squalling red daughter no but i will come inside you and you will be my daughter tom will you stay the night with me and sleep so close that we are one person no but i will lie down on your sheets and taste you there will be feathers of you on my tongue and then i will never forget you tom when we are in line at the convenience store can i put my hands in your back pockets and my lips and nose in your baseball shirt and feel the crook of your shoulder blade no but later you can lie against me and almost touch me and when i go i will leave my shirt for you to sleep in so that always at night you will be pressed up against the thought of me tom if i weep and want to wait until you need me will you promise that someday you will need me no but i will sit in silence while you rage you can knock the chairs down any mountain i will always be the same and you will always wait tom will you climb on top of the dumpster and steal the sun for me its just hanging there and i want it no it will burn my fingers no one can have the sun its on loan from god but i will draw a picture of it and send it to you from richmond and then you can smooth out the paper and you will have a piece of me as well as the sun tom its so hot here and i think im being born will you come back from richmond and baptise me with sex and cool water i will come back from richmond i will smooth the damp spiky hairs from the back of your neck and then i will lick the salt off it then i will leave tom richmond is so far away how will i know how you love me i have left you that is how you will know i now think love is rather deaf than blind for else it could not be that she whom i adore so much should so slight me and cast my love behind im sure my language to her was as sweet and every close did meet in sentence of as subtle feet as hath the youngest he that sits in shadow of apollos tree o but my conscious fears that fly my thoughts between tell me that she hath seen my hundred of gray hairs told seven and forty years read so much waste as she cannot embrace my mountain belly and my rocky face and all these through her eyes have stoppd her ears talking we begin to find the way into our hearts we who knew no words words being a rare commodity in those countries we left behind both refugees and similarly deprived we marvel at the many things there are to say so many variations and colors of the same thought so many different lengths in the words that line up together on our tongues no scarcity no rationing no waiting in line in order to buy the same answer we heard each time we asked that one word owned by the state manufactured by the state serving all purposes equally alike no no no and sometimes never falling into unearthed light or something like that is who i was last night you brought me a drink you didnt know the name of told me i could get it you not the drink which i downed even though it was my th of the night the drink not you dancehall always dancehall a manner of movement learned not easily lost so i wind my hips anyway something is happening to you you bout to startsome shit i say good not because it would be i havent been touched in a while dont start something you cant finish is maybe the worst advice ive ever heard as you drop a handful of my ass thudding down a small flight of stairs thats what i am a small flight of stairs a small flight down i like to think of your silence as the love letters you will not write me as two sax solos from two ages across a stage learning the languages of kissing with your eyes closed i like to think of you as a god to whom i no longer pray as a god i aspire to i like the opening of your joined palms which is like an urn where my ashes find a home the music of your lashes the silent way your body wears out mine mostly i like to think of you at night when a black screen of shining dust shines from your mines to the edge of my skin where you are a lamp of flutters i remember the spectral lashes marigold tamarind secret thing between your thighs of closed kissing eyes at night the possibility of you is a heavy sculpture of heavy bronze at the side of my bed a god and i pray you into life into flesh a long time have i known you why full eighteen years i must confess all pink are you pale blear am i winters mine yours springs comeliness white cemetery lilacs sprout over my temples but soon now the grove entire will bloom about my head to shade my withered brow pallid my sun sinks low and will soon fade on the horizons face and on the mournful doleful hill i see my final dwelling place oh may you from your lips let fall a kiss too long delayed upon my own so that beneath my pall i may rest heart at peace anon my dearest dust could not thy hasty day afford thy drowzy patience leave to stay one hower longer so that we might either sate up or gone to bedd together but since thy finisht labor hath possest thy weary limbs with early rest enjoy it sweetly and thy widdowe bride shall soone repose her by thy slumbring side whose business now is only to prepare my nightly dress and call to prayre mine eyes wax heavy and ye day growes old the dew falls thick my beloved growes cold draw draw ye closed curtaynes and make room my dear my dearest dust i come i come whan that aprille with

might be able to get to the ground was boggy and buzzing the pond was thick with weed and slime it was not the sort of pond anyone would swim in but we did picking and sliding into the water over the bog and bees bees we suddenly noticed were everywhere were settling on our hair as we swam ducks turning surprised eyes our way after twenty years of marriage what is surprising isnt really so much the person you are with but to find yourselves so out of place in this scene cold but not able to get out without stepping over bees so many bees they were not traditionalists they could bear the innovations of plot they could not wait to landscape the plot they had plans for a bed of pansies because pansies hardly ever die in a cold snap because pansies are hardy despite the name when they shoved the trowel into the soil it was with his hand on the handle and hers adding force they knew there were only nine types of people in the world and they knew which ones would close the deal they knew the shirkers by sight they had options they knew about required communication about how i feel and you feel when there was a question of who did the dishes and who did the cat box it was settled in house and never required an outside contractor but the pansies got stem spot leaf rot and mildew when they looked at their options it seemed there werent really that many after all they swore to uphold the bonds and the principles and the yelling they swore to oral sex they dressed to the nines and they walked the aisle they stood up and received the standard narration often the slightest gesture is most telling as when he reaches tenderly in passing to pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall of her hair or even the absence of all gesture the way she doesnt need to turn to know who in this gathering of friends has touched her it was as if he dreamed some private garden perhaps he woke from it mid reach to find his hand too near her hair in this crowded yard and maybe even now shes shuttering in shes even better than you or i at that a storm of worry and recrimination did anyone notice how could he do that here by seamlessly continuing to tell you about her trip to see her favorite vermeer this morning in the delft show at the met so now they say she isnt weighing pearls or gold or anything its just the light gleaming off empty scales so much is hard to know for sure if i confronted her shed say it was just a leaf who could afford to disagree could we now shes explaining how the girl faces a mirror we cant see into and how behind her hangs a gloomy painting of the last judgment over her head god floats in a cloud she says like a thought balloon but you dont hear youre watching me i nod the first retainer he gave to her was a golden wedding ring the second late at night he woke up leaned over on an elbow and kissed her the third and the last he died with and gave up loving and lived with her fly from me does all i would have stay the blossoms did not stay stayed not the frost in the yellow grass every leash snapped every contract void and flying in the crows lingers but a moment in the graveyard oaks yet inside me it never stops so i cant tell who is chasing who chased i can sleep into afternoon and still wake soaring so out come the bats down spiral swifts into the chimneys hey im real say the dream figments then are gone like breath prints on a window handwriting in snow whatever i hold however flies apart the children skip into the park come out middle aged with children of their own your laugh over the phone will it ever answer me again too much flying photons perforating us voices hurtling into outer space whitman out past neptune dickinson retreating yet getting brighter remember running barefoot across hot sand into the seas hovering remember my hand as we darted against the holiday broadway throng catching your train just as it was leaving hey its real your face like a comet horses coming from the field for morning oats insects hitting a screen the message nearly impossible to read obscured by light because carried by mercury i love you im coming sure what fluttered is now gone maybe a smudge left maybe a delicate under feather only then that too yes rained away and when the flying is flown and the hearts a useless sliver in a glacier and the gown hangs still as meat in a locker and eyesight is dashed down glass and the mouth rust stoppered will some twinge still pass between us still some fledgling pledge and what is love it is a doll dressd up for idleness to cosset nurse and dandle a thing of soft misnomers so divine that silly youth doth think to make itself divine by loving and so goes on yawning and doting a whole summer long till misss comb is made a pearl tiara and common wellingtons turn romeo boots then cleopatra lives at number seven and antony resides in brunswick square fools if some passions high have warmd the world if queens and soldiers have playd deep for hearts it is no reason why such agonies should be more common than the growth of weeds fools make me whole again that weighty pearl the queen of egypt melted and ill say that ye may love in spite of beaver hats never the time and the place and the loved one all together this path how soft to pace this may what magic weather where is the loved ones face in a dream that loved ones face meets mine but the house is narrow the place is bleak where outside rain and wind combine with a furtive ear if i strive to speak with a hostile eye at my flushing cheek with a malice that marks each word each sign o enemy sly and serpentine uncoil thee from the waking man do i hold the past thus firm and fast yet doubt if the future hold i can this path so soft to pace shall lead thro the magic of may to herself indeed or narrow if needs the house must be outside are the storms and strangers we oh close safe warm sleep i and she i and she all night the sound had come back again and again falls this quiet persistent rain what am i to myself that must be remembered insisted upon so often is it that never the ease even the hardness of rain falling will have for me something other than this something not so insistent am i to be locked in this final uneasiness love if you love me lie next to me be for me like rain the getting out of the tiredness the fatuousness the semi lust of intentional indifference

first my being to me gave by kind from mothers womb derivd by due descent the second is my sovereign queen most kind that honour and large richesse to me lent the third my love my lifes last ornament by whom my spirit out of dust was raised to speak her praise and glory excellent of all alive most worthy to be praised ye three elizabeths for ever live that three such graces did unto me give variable changeable yes there are days when people like us are like that maybe under some other sky something like glory smiles on us maybe there life is clear maybe there things open up on the way the sea stretches out to the horizon but us were blown by chance the way wind blows blades of grass lightly blowing them all one way and then there are days when we feel april the fields of april making us feel our bodies longing to be held and fucked into oblivion bodies fertile as a field in april swollen trembling to be touched and under the influences of rains pouring down as if pure spirit poured into us like rain that thing called soul sprouts and branches and entangles us in lush bowers and thickets of illusion oh yes days come along when were calm clear childhood sunsets lagoons rippling sapphire days when a verse a sudden whistle days when a mountain and bird passing over it days when even our own pain and what we feel it to be like make us smile and sure there are days when were so disgusting so sordid to ourselves its like were dark stone in the darkness inside flint then nighttime surprises us its lamplight dizzying cold profuse glinting off tossed coins of the good the terrible shining with the gleam of that primal metal and other days come come when women want to cry their come cries and use us as their own days when were itching to get a woman naked and then we cant face it cant stand it somehow they want us but we dont know how to want them back arm tightening around a waist hand cupping a breast we dont dare touch the roundness of an apple or a pear the round earth spins us off into space and then there arrive days so dismal and stupefied and numb that the idiot soughing of a pine grove sounds like weeping and what some idiot called the soul whines and wails and carries on with what some other idiot calls the pain of the world and maybe not god himself that absolute fool can make that wind less cutting or make it stop and then there comes certain to come oh my earth i love beyond any of my days a day a day a day when my sail catches the wind and drags the anchor up out of the bottom muck and nothing can withstand that wind blowing by talking to itself talking talking and the day is mine and yours and every living things the day when nobody and nothing can keep us from getting up and going no matter who we are the day when our leaving is the same as our arriving i understand sure hygiene these days if youre not paying attention with all these sicknesses you think im not aware im not saying not to bathe are you crazy you dont want to wash im just saying to not go overboard because theres clean thats fine but not clean and shiny its just that people now bath foams bath salts a bar of soaps not good enough no instead sometimes by washing too much some things even get lost the other day there was one lady i didnt know her even if you tell me her name shes not from here shes from rimini we had met each other by chance two months ago then we met again but its not like now im wanting im just telling you to give you an idea it was tuesday afternoon at her house her husband was away she started to unzip me she was wearing a dressing gown wed been drinking wed danced then we went to bed she climbed on top of me sssh and today is thursday and i still smell her do you understand you have not conquered me it is the surge of love itself that beats against my will it is the sting of conflict the old urge that calls me still it is not you i love it is the form and shadow of all lovers who have died that gives you all the freshness of a warm and unfamiliar bride it is your name i breathe your hands i seek it will be you when you are gone and yet the dream the name i never speak is that that lures me on it is the golden summons the bright wave of banners calling me anew it is all beauty perilous and grave it is not you it was something id overheard one evening at a party a man i liked enormously saying to a mutual friend a woman wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips that belled below each breast well ive always preferred athens greece seems to me a country of the day rome im afraid strikes me as being a city of the night of course i knew instantly just what he meant not simply because i love standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening as the constellations pulse low in the roman sky the whole mind of night that i know so well shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite almost divine irony no and it wasnt only that rome was my city of the night that it was here id chosen to live when i grew tired of my ancient life as the underground man and it wasnt that romes darkness was of the kind that consoles so many vacancies of the soul my rome with its endless history of falls no it was that this dark was the deep sensual dark of the dreamer this dark was like the violet fur spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of the she wolf all the sequins above in sequence the white buds lost in those fields of ever deepening gentians a dark like the polished back of a mirror the pool of the night scalloped and hanging above me the inverted reflection of a last odd narcissus one night my friend nico came by close to three a m as we drank a little wine i could see the black of her pupils blown wide the spread ripples of the opiate night and nico pulled herself close to me her mouth almost touching my mouth as she sighed look and deep within the pupil of her left eye almost like the mirage of a ships distant hanging lantern rocking with the waves i could see at the most remote end of the receding circular hallway of her eye there at its doorway at the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil a tiny dangling crucifix silver lit by the ragged shards of starlight reflecting in her as quietly as pain as simply as pain some years later i saw nico on stage in new york singing inside loosed sheets of shattered light a fluid kaleidoscope washing over her the way any naked emerging venus steps up along the scalloped lip of her shell innocent and raw as fate slowly obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple deadly love of sexual sincerity i didnt bother to say hello i decided to remember the way in rome out driving at night shed laugh as she let her head fall back against the cracked red leather of my old lancias seats the soft black wind fanning her pale chalky hair out along its currents ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves the sad lucent malevolence of the heavens falling both of us racing silently as light nowhere then forever into the mind of the roman night it lies in our hands in crystals too intricate to decipher it goes into the skillet without being given a second thought it spills on the floor so fine we step all over it we carry a pinch behind each eyeball it breaks out on our foreheads we store it inside our bodies in secret wineskins at supper we pass it around the table talking of holidays and the sea i know the origin of rocks settling out of water hatching crystals from fire put under pressure in various designs i gathered pretty picnic after picnic and i know about love a little igneous lust the slow affections of the sedimentary the pressure on earth out of sight to rise up into material something solid you can hold a whole mountain for example or a loose collection of pebbles you forgot you were keeping to an army wife in sardis some say a cavalry corps some infantry some again will maintain that the swift oars of our fleet are the finest sight on dark earth but i say that whatever one loves is this is easily proved did not helen she who had scanned the flower of the worlds manhood choose as first among men one who laid troys honor in ruin warped to his will forgetting love due her own blood her own child she wandered far with him so anactoria although you being far away forget us the dear sound of your footstep and light glancing in your eyes would move me more than glitter of lydian horse or armored tread of mainland infantry september is work to the center of arguments and controversies prejudgments and incomprehensions what will i love if not that that was enigma the years of infancy memory says and there we are with the demon of the art of living traced on the glass of some window in the beauty of the night of may clear of moon to the lume of a candle there was a design like the profile of a landscape almost abandoned gone but not gone yet its fascinating these mysterious uncovered feelings enigma of an afternoon of autumn the picture of which is a composition of the eye of my mind every hour that i watch this picture i see again still that moment nevertheless the moment is an enigma for me in how much is inexplicable the physical things hide in the architecture of the event the enigma of a mock up of a shadow the spectral and eternal aspect of the moment praises to you for being one great box of surprise your head the scene of a wonderful theater of the most tender gray of the fog that joins the sky to the earth a tangling of truth and memory mythology and iconography i watch with the eye of the mind the city that accommodates that one beautiful day that is now infinite it deepens it begins the cyclical method memory is deeply not alive its a mock up and this renders it hateful yet it is not a fiction is a truth indeed a sad and monstrous truth i was assigned to you together we were a beautiful and melancholic picture this last picture is the realization of the overwhelming moment in which the acute eye perceives you as a now that is over a now that is fixed in the swept past i poured a whiskey and soda watching the tree outside dissolve light going backward pushed to corners to the white sliver of wood around the door where was that river seething with light i recall the banks menaced by wasps swollen on summer sap a cement hollow stuck with their strange cradles a woozy stench of damp clay the blunt poison of water snakes i do remember someoneclose warm flesh pushed to the sandthe ocean a dark noiseechoing gulls and a wail of forlorn lovemoonlight like yellowed keyson his antique pianomusic across the water our songtides pulled awful and endlessas the spine of memory the light is lost my glass is hollow the door is luminous like a firefly at midnight allegiance is assigned forever when the mind chooses and stamps the will thus i must love you still through good and ill but though we cannot part we may retract the heart and build such privacies as self regard agrees conduce to ease so manners will repair the ravage of despair which generous love invites preferring quiet nights to vain delights a face that should content me wondrous well should not be fair but lovely to behold with gladsome cheer all grief for to expel with sober looks so would i that it should speak without words such words as none can tell her tress also should be of crisped gold with wit and thus might chance i might be tied and knit again the knot that should not slide inamoratas with an approbation bestowed his title blessed his inclination he wakes unwinds elaborately a cat tawny reluctant royal he is fat and fine this morning definite reimbursed he waits a moment he designs his reign that no performance may be plain or vain then rises in a clear delirium he sheds with his pajamas shabby days and his desertedness his intricate fear the postponed resentments and the prim precautions now at his bath would you deny him lavender or take away the power of his pine what smelly substitute heady as wine would you provide life must be aromatic there must be scent somehow there must be some would you have flowers in his life suggest asters a really good geranium a white carnation would you prescribe a show with the cold lilies formal chrysanthemum magnificence poinsettias and emphatic red of prize roses might his happiest alternative you muse be after all a bit of gentle garden in the best of taste and straight tradition maybe so but you forget or did you ever know his heritage of cabbage and pigtails old intimacy with alleys garbage pails down in the deep but always beautiful south where roses blush their blithest it is said and sweet magnolias put chanel to shame no he has not a flower to his name except a feather one for his lapel apart from that if he should think of flowers it is in terms of dandelions or death ah there is little hope you might as well unless you care to set the world a boil and do a lot of equalizing things remove a little ermine say from kings shake hands with paupers and appoint them men for instance certainly you might as well leave him his lotion lavender and oil let us proceed let us inspect together with his meticulous and serious love the innards of this closet which is a vault whose glory is not diamonds not pearls not silver plate with just enough dull shine but wonder suits in yellow and in wine sarcastic green and zebra striped cobalt with shoulder padding that is wide and cocky and determined as his pride ballooning pants that taper off to ends scheduled to choke precisely here are hats like bright umbrellas and hysterical ties like narrow banners for some gathering war people are so in need in need of help people want so much that they do not know below the tinkling trade of little coins the gold impulse not possible to show or spend promise piled over and betrayed these kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk then they receive the brave and beautiful embrace of some of that equivocal wool he looks into his mirror loves himself the neat curve here the angularity that is appropriate at just its place the technique of a variegated grace here is all his sculpture and his art and all his architectural design perhaps you would prefer to this a fine value of marble complicated stone would have him think with horror of baroque rococo you forget and you forget he dances down the hotel steps that keep remnants of last nights high life and distress as spat out purchased kisses and spilled beer he swallows sunshine with a secret yelp passes to coffee and a roll or two has breakfasted out sounds about him smear become a unit he hears and does not hear the alarm clock meddling in somebodys sleep childrens governed sunday happiness the dry tone of a plane a womans oath consumptions spiritless expectoration an indignant robins resolute donation pinching a track through apathy and din restaurant vendors weeping and the l that comes on like a slightly horrible thought pictures too as usual are blurred he sees and does not see the broken windows hiding their shame with newsprint little girl with ribbons decking wornness little boy wearing the trousers with the decentest patch to honor sunday women on their way from service temperate holiness arranged ably on asking faces men estranged from music and from wonder and from joy but far familiar with the guiding awe of foodlessness he loiters restaurant vendors weep or out of them rolls a restless glee the lonesome blues the long lost blues i want a big fat mama down these sore avenues comes no saint sa ns no piquant elusive grieg and not tschaikovskys wayward eloquence and not the shapely tender drift of brahms but could he love them since a man must bring to music what his mother spanked him for when he was two bits of forgotten hate devotion whether or not his mattress hurts the little dream his father humored the thing his sister did for money what he ate for breakfast and for dinner twenty years ago last autumn all his skipped desserts the pasts of his ancestors lean against him crowd him fog out his identity hundreds of hungers mingle with his own hundreds of voices advise so dexterously he quite considers his reactions his judges he walks most powerfully alone that everything is simply what it is but movie time approaches time to boo the heros

and eye thickness and height such minor points as these from sunday to sunday but no matter what her name or body positively shes in queen lace stockings with ambitious heels that strain to kiss the calves and vivid shoes frontless and backless chinese fingernails earrings three layers of lipstick intense hat dripping with the most voluble of veils her affable extremes are like sweet bombs about him whom no middle grace or good could gratify he had no education in quiet arts of compromise he would not understand your counsels on control nor thank you for your late trouble at joes eats you get

you have changed me already i am a fireball that is hurtling towards the sky to where you are you can choose not to look up but i am a giant orange ball that is throwing sparks upon your face oh look at them shake upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change o too this is so dramatic this shaking of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be so you ran and hid under a large tree she was graceful i think that tree although soon she will wither into ten black snakes upon your throat and when she does i will be wandering as i always am a graceful lady that is part museum of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets i will hold your voice in a little box and when you come upon me i wont look back at you you will feel a hand upon your heart while i place your voice back into the heart from where it came from and i will not cry also although you will expect me to i was wiser too than you had expected for i knew all along you were mine with this

heels we howled that day we never left his castro flat his rhinestone glittered and everywhere the smell of cologne no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o if i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone and now my marian from its shackles free my wearied fancy turns for ease to thee to thee my compass through lifes varied stream my constant object and unfailing theme torn from the bosom of my souls repose and self devoted to surrounding woes oft oer my solitary thoughts i brood for passing crowds to me are solitude catch thy loved image on thy beauties dwell improved by graces which no tongue can tell the look which i have seen by love endeared the voice to love attuned which i have heard or rapt in thoughts of higher worth adore thy virtues drawn by memrys faithful store or court as now obsequious at her shrine the muse unkind on evry theme but thine nor foreign deem from such a frame of mind this tale to meet thy gracious ear designed to me and to my state alike belong the subject and the moral of my song tis true no serpent of envenomed breath hath stung my love ere yet a bride to death and o may heavn for many years to come preserve her life from natures final doom yet is she lost to me in substance dead with half the traversed globe between us spread dreadful transition in one moments cost my souls whole wealth i saw and held and lost the fate and silence closed lifes blissful scene its being past as it had never been the sad rememberance only now remains and by contrasting aggravates my pains hope still attendant and delusive stands and points but coldly points to distant lands gilds their faint summits with her flattring ray but deserts rocks and seas obstruct the way and age and sickness and the clouds that teem with unknown thunders through the prospect gleam ah me no gods nor angels now descend the sons of men in pity to befriend my sufferings else might some kind spirit move to give me back on terms the wife i love and more than half my life would i resign for health her purchase and herself for mine borne by the powrs of air or she should rise or i rejoin her through the distant skies no more my thoughts in solitude should mourn my sweet companion from my presence torn nor rigid duty force me to remain and see her sails diminish on the main to her my destined hours though few id give and while i lived a life of bliss id live wanting leads to worse than oddity the bones creak like bamboo in wind and strain toward a better life outside the body the life anything has that isnt human feel the chair under you what does it want does lust bend it silly like a rubber crutch tell a tree about the silky clasp of cunt it wont shift an inch it wont ache to touch let me not cruise for teens in a red sports car or glare too long at what bubbles their clothes let me never hustle file clerks in a bar keep me from the beach when the hot wind blows if i must go mad let it be dignified lock me up where ill feel like wood where wanting wont send me flopping outside where my bones will shut up where ill be good it is most true that eyes are formed to serve the inward light and that the heavenly part ought to be king from whose rules who do swerve rebels to nature strive for their own smart it is most true what we call cupids dart an image is which for ourselves we carve and fools adore in temple of our heart till that good god make church and churchman starve true that true beauty virtue is indeed whereof this beauty can be but a shade which elements with mortal mixture breed true that on earth we are but pilgrims made and should in soul up to our country move true and yet true that i must stella love when i stood behind his desk chair and when he sat on rare occasions on the porch sage of anacostia they called him i smelled his mane glorious and as a hand saddle the aroma of hair took me to neckline and below in egypt long after napoleon had shot off the face of the sphinx i thought of this man and the cusp of his palms on my shoulder blades as always he was carrying the mail of gender his touch immaculate in the true blend of the cortex and of the complex risen on a pulpit and after the hot air wintry parlance the syllables of my name in his ear when he touched me as he had touched me then i had my suspicions of english ladies actresses ghosts of the thames concubines as we had been into this next century and they had their wiles with him i do not feel forbidden the cameo ring he gave me recession of his maleness all i need and highlights of my dark profile any children we might have had buried in architecture and the hate of his daughter rosetta who i have spoken to over the grate the sun rises and sets in our neighborhood i will burn these but when i place my fingers in that mane it is to the saddle he will come if yet i have not all thy love dear i shall never have it all i cannot breathe one other sigh to move nor can intreat one other tear to fall and all my treasure which should purchase thee sighs tears and oaths and letters i have spent yet no more can be due to me than at the bargain made was meant if then thy gift of love were partial that some to me some should to others fall dear i shall never have thee all or if then thou gavest me all all was but all which thou hadst then but if in thy heart since there be or shall new love created be by other men which have their stocks entire and can in tears in sighs in oaths and letters outbid me this new love may beget new fears for this love was not vowd by thee and yet it was thy gift being general the ground thy heart is mine whatever shall grow there dear i should have it all yet i would not have all yet he that hath all can have no more and since my love doth every day admit new growth thou shouldst have new rewards in store thou canst not every day give me thy heart if thou canst give it then thou never gavest it loves riddles are that though thy heart depart it stays at home and thou with losing savest it but we will have a way more liberal than changing hearts to join them so we shall be one and one anothers all where we could be boys together this region of want the campestrial flat the adolescents roving across the plat come hither he of the hard would call me hither sheer abdomen sheer slickensides the feldspar buttesthat mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust and i could kiss his tits and he could destroy me on the inflorescent slopes in his darkest dingles upon the grasslands raffish plaits and he could roll mein coyote brush i who was banished to the barrencould come back into his fold and iwould let him lay me down on the cold cold ground clouds above lenticular the spreading fundament a glorious breech among the thunderheadsand in their midst a great white heron magnifies the day wed keep together he and i and wed gain meaning from our boyage wed pursueeach other through the crush of darkling rifts climb into each others precipitous coombes where would it end this brush and bush this bromeand blazing star there is always some new wayto flex a limb and find its secret drupe not only the hope of nature the nature of hope so long as culverts carry us so long as we stay ripeto one anothers lips and welcoming to hands as long as we extend our spans to tangle them as spinning insects do their glistered floss this is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen rather the trumpets bell is but a prelude it says we all are beautiful at least once and if youd watch over me we can be beautiful again i queer are the ways of a man i know he comes and stands in a careworn craze and looks at the sands and the seaward haze with moveless hands and face and gaze then turns to go and what does he see when he gazes so ii they say he sees as an instant thing more clear than to day a sweet soft scene that once was in play by that briny green yes notes alway warm real and keen what his back years bring a phantom of his own figuring iii of this vision of his they might say more not only there does he see this sight but everywhere in his brain day night as if on the air it were drawn rose bright yea far from that shore does he carry this vision of heretofore iv a ghost girl rider and though toil tried he withers daily time touches her not but she still rides gaily in his rapt thought on that shagged and shaly atlantic spot and as when first eyed draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide a recipe for lamb tagine demands a mysterious ingredient raz el hanout animal vegetable compound of kings like myrrh i decide not to look it up to wait and see at first it is everything we seek but cant express then it reverses everything thrust upon us think fast by the universe like the leg my friend tom caught when a cyclist got clipped by a car the driver stinking drunk at am severed above the knee the leg flung itself into the air a javelin tom always quick reached up and caught it but the story has a twist after the cyclist died in an ambulance the widow inexplicably came on to tom not that tom is unattractive indeed he is the sort of man id throw myself at if i were a leg its hard to imagine the sex that tom and this woman would have had there in the hotel room with the blackout curtains pulled ive never had sex with tom myself but if i had been that leg or that woman i might have whispered what fine reflexes you have sir sir say something tender cradle me against the guttural gasp from your solar plexus oh sir i sense the tip of bone on skin a surge of d j vu i am coming i am about to come your shuddering lover your raz el hanout that neither fame nor love might wanting be to greatness cary i sing that and thee whose house if it no other honor had in only thee might be both great and glad who to upbraid the sloth of this our time durst valor make almost but not a crime which deed i know not whether were more high or thou more happy it to justify against thy fortune when no foe that day could conquer thee but chance who did betray love thy great loss which a renown hath won to live when broick not stands nor ruhr doth run love honors which of best example be when they cost dearest and are done most free though every fortitude deserves applause it may be much or little in the cause hes valiantst that dares fight and not for pay that virtuous is when the rewards away when my aunt died my uncle raised his hands like a prophet in the bible ive lost my girl he said ive lost my girl over and over shaking his head i didnt know what to say where to look my quiet uncle raising his voice to silence my aunt was eighty seven listen my uncle said sighing like a tree alone at night women know every midnight on new years eve when others sang and laughed and hugged your aunt looked at me tears in her eyes sixty years she knew one day wed kiss good bye had no direction to go but up and this the shattery road its surface graining trickle in late thaw is nothing amiss this melt the sign assures us natural cycle and whoosh the water a dream of forgotten white past aspens colored in sulfur they trembled would poor sinners in redemption song shed their tainted leaves i tell you what boy i was writing lyrics to reflect my passions the smell of a bare neck in summer a thin trail of hairs disappearing below the top button of cut offs the lean arched back of a cyclist straining to ascend a hill in the starlight i wandered streets no better than fields the cul de sacs of suburbia just as treacherous just as empty if wood doves sang in the branches of the acacias i could not hear them anyone lost in that same night was lost in another tract the air pulsed and dandelion pollen blew from green stalks that was all and yes someone took me in his car and another against the low fence in the park at the end of our block under the willow branches where gnats made a furious cloud at dawn and chased us away i knew how it felt to lie in a patch of marigolds golden stains the way morning swarmed a hidden rooftop the catbirds singing the feel of ruin upon lips rubbed raw throughout the night granite peaks here the earth has asserted itself and the ice asserted and human intimacies conspired to keep us low and apart for an ice age i knew you only as an idea of longing a voice in the next yard whispering through the chink a vagabond outlined against the sky among the drying grass we journey this day to darkness the chasm walls lift us on their scaly backs the glaciers relinquish their secrets that sound is the ice bowing and the sound underneath the trickle the past released disappearing you pinnacle of my life stand with me on this brink half clouded basin caked in flat grays the very demise of green you have surmounted the craggy boundary between us you open a place for me in earth receiving my song for haines eason i move my hands in these woods to find her sex parts we discover our sex parts make heat and blue light we become outlines of ourselves long scratches in the sky we have a daughter who was never born she lives in the house we never built but in this new light you can almost see its tattered roof i feel the spring far off far off the faint far scent of bud and leaf oh how can spring take heart to come to a world in grief deep grief the sun turns north the days grow long later the evening star grows bright how can the daylight linger on for men to fight still fight the grass is waking in the ground soon it will rise and blow in waves how can it have the heart to sway over the graves new graves under the boughs where lovers walked the apple blooms will shed their breath but what of all the lovers now parted by death grey death fair iris i love and hourly i die but not for a lip nor a languishing eye shes fickle and false and there i agree for i am as false and as fickle as she we neither believe what either can say and neither believing we neither betray tis civil to swear and say things of course we mean not the taking for better or worse when present we love when absent agree i think not of iris nor iris of me the legend of love no couple can find so easy to part or so equally joind i has not found started finished is morning poem the poem i was writing about i having sex with the man i left her husband for the night before or maybe just this morning a sex poem so to speak so to say so as to lay a foundation for what sex i lost my sex poem how did it go i know it was called sex something about my bosky acres my unshrubbd down bout all being tight and yare bring in tiresias did you say soothe tiresias who lies fucking more whoops who likes fucking more bring in the old thought allen grossman doing yeats that life prepares us for what never happens today the color of my sex was lavender then yellow gold then muted mossy grey and green i bid my lover lower i bid my lover shhhhhhh i bid my lover linger i bid my lover golover go see i bid my lover stay away i notices it is almost time to pick up her children from school i realizes she has gotten nowhere nowhere near it much less inside it wasted another morning cant fucking write a poem to save is life oh well i is at least working i pulls on her tight jeans her big boots her puffy parka i remote starts her car is car is a red toyota runner with racing stripe that doesnt have enough power for i is car stereo also doesnt have enough power for i i drives cross town listening to dylan who has plenty of power for i i wonders how why dylan isnt is man i gets some looks from some lesser men some in better more powerful trucks even though is dirty dirty blonde hair is covered by a woolen cap i feels the power of being a single mom in a red truck i knows it is not enough power i thinks i am the man i suffered i was there i is almost broke but i thinks i live more in a continuous present that i enjoy i thinks amor fati i notices the chugach mountains i notices the chugach mountains sometimes look good and sometimes bad i remembers that yesterday the chugach mountains looked desolate and dirty and roadblocky i notices the chugach mountains look particularly beautiful today covered in sun and snow i almost thinks bathed in sun and snow but stops herself i feels that i can maybe find really start really finish her sex poem tomorrow i likes the dubus thing about adultery having a morality of its own i also likes human drama i really enjoyed i heart huckabees i thought sex was overrated for a long time then not for a year and a half and now again i gives well has given good head i takes it like a man i thinks there should be a new new sexualized and radicalized poetry of the self i knows the single minded frenzy of a raving madman but i mostly keeps her head i remembers that as long ago as boris tomashevsky a leading russian formalist critic observed that the autobiographical poem is one that mythologizes the poets life in accordance with the conventions of his time it relates not what has occurred but what should have occurred presenting an idealized image of the poet as representative of his literary school i wants to be a man like marjorie perloff helen hennessy vendler boris tomashevsky i thinks on the other hand i mean i like in art when the artist doesnt know what he knows in general he only knows what he knows specifically i thinks that mantel piece is clean enough or my name isnt bob rauschenberg i just wishes i could talk more smarter theory no i just wishes i could write more smarter poems no i thinks why i am a poet and not a i thinks kalytiak davis paints a picture i wants to include the word coruscate in it and possibly a quote from rudolf steiner i wishes she could remember abrams definition of the structure of the greater romantic lyric but that it presents a determinate speaker in a particularized and usually localized outdoor setting whom we overhear as he carries on in a fluent vernacular which rises easily to a more formal speech a sustained colloquy sometimes with himself or with the outer scene but more frequently with a silent human auditor present or absent and that he speaker begins with a description of the landscape and that an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied but integral process of memory thought anticipation and feeling which remains closely involved with the outer scene and that in the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight faces up to a tragic loss comes to a moral decision or resolves an emotional problem and that often the poem rounds upon itself to end where it began at the outer scene but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation evades her i wants to say silent human auditor are you absent or present but i knows i makes has made that move too often i knows i is alone in her red truck i reconsiders perhaps it is like giving good head i thinks his his he himself but not too bitterly then i thinks i then i thinks you i has not told her lover that i is not in love with him any longer but i knows he knows must know i has not told her lover that i had a long conversation with is x husband on the phone last night i thinks my sidestepping and obliquities i thinks love is what went wrong i feels elizabeth bishop reprimanding i i thinks like a gentle loving firm almost slap but really just a squeeze of not on the hand from a the mother neither one of them had for very long long enough i has not thought of is dead mother in a long time i thinks of jonatham letham and his dead mother and his wall of books i thinks of mark reagan and his walls and walls of books and how his landlord fearing collapse made him move to the bottom floor i thinks of doug teter and his smaller but still wall of books i thinks of jude law i thinks jude law probably doesnt know how to read i knows that no lover can be her objective correlative still i thinks so true a lover as theagenes i thinks so constant a friend as pylades i thinks so valiant a man as orlando i thinks so right a prince as xenophons cyrus i thinks so excellent a man in every way as virgils aeneas i notices dylan is almost done singing to ramona i loves everything passes everything changes just do what you think you should do i thinks dylan is singing to i i thinks he means now and now and now daily i is almost there i wonders if is meditation is too long has gotten away from i i thinks it should take precisely as long as the ride minutes tops well in a snowstorm i knows it is not snowing i wonders if i should at this point even refer to is meditation i thinks man can embody truth but he cannot know it i thinks especially under stress of psychological crisis i thinks whats worse anaphora or anaphrodesia i thinks of the diaphragm still inside her i shutters at the audacity of her sex i is exactly on time to pick up her daughter i must wait another minutes to retrieve her son i will try and remember to remove it promptly when they get back to is house i e home i has fucked with the facts so you think shes robert lowell but whoever saw a girl like robert lowell i doesnt care if you silent human auditor present or absent never heard of could give a flying fuck about robert lowell fly fly my friends i have my death wound fly see there that boy that murdring boy i say who like a thief hid in dark bush doth lie till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey so tyrant he no fitter place could spy nor so fair level in so secret stay as that sweet black which veils the heavnly eye there himself with his shot he close doth lay poor passenger pass now thereby i did and stayd pleasd with the prospect of the place while that black hue from me the bad guest hid but straight i saw motions of lightning grace and then descried the glistring of his dart but ere i could fly thence it piercd my heart as fresh garbage is as dirt sucked out of a fingernail as a wall clean of prostitutes when i am this i am at the mercy of my nakedness a pillar of undress whose power i do not know how to wield i watch porn i study the geometry of limbs splayed not the moan but the angle of a moan i swallow in this way i am a thief sometimes i forget my body go untouched until i am touched scream sometimes i want to eat my breasts down to their bitter rind spit them out i want to be the bitter rind without suck and easily thrown easily thrown i want to be the pebble thumbed wished upon before enveloping the lake i sink in i sink in you the lake by lake i mean gutter a water that does not hold me well here we are not the bodies our mothers made if you are to hold me hold me as a gun grip me profit the dark the unattended purse the pair of heels darting from us in dull claps sharpening against the concrete as teeth against a stone accompanied to the campi flegrei by a shadow she listened to voices rise from the darkness then recede instruments sustained them when one had finished others played false proportions sung boldly rain on the roof tiles o selve o campi i arise from dreams of thee in the first sweet sleep of night when the winds are breathing low and the stars are shining bright i arise from dreams of thee and a spirit in my feet hath led me who knows how to thy chamber window sweet the wandering airs they faint on the dark the silent stream the champak odours fail like sweet thoughts in a dream the nightingales complaint it dies upon her heart as i must on thine oh belov d as thou art oh lift me from the grass i die i faint i fail let thy love in kisses rain on my lips and eyelids pale my cheek is cold and white alas my heart beats loud and fast oh press it to thine own again where it will break at last gone to seed ailanthus the poverty tree take a phrase then fracture it the pods gaudy nectarine shades ripening to parrots taking flight all crest and tail feathers a musical idea macaws scarlet and violet tangerine as a song the hue of sunset where my street becomes water and down shore this phantom city skylines mere hazy silhouette the altos liquid geometry weaves a way of thinking a way of breaking synchronistic through time so the girl on the comer has the bones of my face the old photos beneath the kansas city hat black fedora lifting hair off my neck cooling the sweat of a night long tidal pull from bar to bar the night we went to find birds grave erics chartreuse perfume that poured on dress i lived days and nights inside made love and slept in a mesh and slur of zipper down the back women smoked the boulevards with gardenias after hours asphalt shower slick ozone charging air with sixteenth notes that endless convertible ride to find the grave whose sleep and melody wept neglect enough to torch us for a while through snare sweep of broom on pavement the rumpled musk of lovers sheets charred cornices topping crosstown gutted buildings torches us still cat screech matte blue steel of pistol stroked across the victims cheek where fleet shoes jazz this dark and peeling block that one vine street olive we had the music but not the pyrotechnics rhinestone straps lashing my shoes heels sinking through earth and eric in casual drag mocha cheekbones rouged that flawless plummy mouth a style for moving heel tap and lighter flick lion moan of buses pulling away through the static brilliant fizz of taffeta on nyloned thighs light mist etherous rinsed our faces and what happens when you touch a finger to the cold stone that jazz and death played down to phrases take it all and break forever a man with gleaming sax an open sill in summertime and the fire escapes iron zigzag tumbles crazy notes to a girl cooling her knees wearing one of those dresses no one wears anymore darts and spaghetti straps glitzy fabrics foaming an iron bedstead the horns alarm then fluid brass chromatics extravagant ailanthus the courtyards poverty tree is spike and wing slate blue mourning dove sudden cardinal flame if you dont live it it wont come out your horn once i wasnt always so plain i was strewn feathers on a cross of dune an expanse of ocean at my feet garlands of gulls sirens and gulls they couldnt tame you you know as well as they to be a dove is to bear the falcon at your breast your nights your seas my fear is simple heart faced above a flare of etchings a lineage in letters my sudden stare its you its you sang the heart upon its mantel pelvis blush of my breath catch of my see beautiful bird its you my lady fair with soft arms what can i say to you words words as if all worlds were there all day i tried to distinguish need from desire now in the dark i feel only bitter sadness for us the builders the planers of wood because i have been looking steadily at these elms and seen the process that creates the writhing stationary tree is torment and have understood it will make no forms but twisted forms ay

earth but a players stage mount we unto the sky i am sick i must die lord have mercy on us in love if love be love if love be ours faith and unfaith can neer be equal powers unfaith in aught is want of faith in all it is the little rift within the lute that by and by will make the music mute and ever widening slowly silence all the little rift within the lovers lute or little pitted speck in garnerd fruit that rotting inward slowly moulders all it is not worth the keeping let it go but shall it answer darling answer no and trust me not at all or all in all the snow is deep on the ground always the light falls softly down on the hair of my belov d this is a good world the war has failed god shall not forget us who made the snow waits where love is only a few go mad the sky moves in its whiteness like the withered hand of an old king god shall not forget us who made the sky knows of our love the snow is beautiful on the ground and always the lights of heaven glow softly down on the hair of my belov d first it is one day without you then two and soon our point moot and our solution diluted and our class action if ever was is no longer suited wherewith i give to looting through the war chest of our past like a wily anne bonny who snatches at plunder or graft but the wreck of that ransack that strongbox our splintering coffer the claptrap bastard of the best we had to offer is sog soaked and clammy empty but for sand like the knuckle white cup of my urgent ghastly hands in which nothing but the ghost of love is held damn it to hell you keep me waiting in a truck with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch while you piss against the south side of a tree hurry ive got nothing on under my skirt tonight that still excites you but this pickup has no windows and the seat one fake leather thigh pressed close to mine is cold im the same size shape make as twenty years ago but get inside me start the engine youll have the strength the will to move ill pull you push well tear each other in half come on baby lay me down on my back pretend you dont owe me a thing and maybe well roll out of here leaving the past stacked up behind us old newspapers nobodys ever got to read again this is her picture as she was it seems a thing to wonder on as though mine image in the glass should tarry when myself am gone i gaze until she seems to stir until mine eyes almost aver that now even now the sweet lips part to breathe the words of the sweet heart and yet the earth is over her alas even such the thin drawn ray that makes the prison depths more rude the drip of water night and day giving a tongue to solitude yet only this of loves whole prize remains save what in mournful guise takes counsel with my soul alone save what is secret and unknown below the earth above the skies in painting her i shrind her face mid mystic trees where light falls in hardly at all a covert place where you might think to find a din of doubtful talk and a live flame wandering and many a shape whose name not itself knoweth and old dew and your own footsteps meeting you and all things going as they came a deep dim wood and there she stands as in that wood that day for so was the still movement of her hands and such the pure lines gracious flow and passing fair the type must seem unknown the presence and the dream tis she though of herself alas less than her shadow on the grass or than her image in the stream that day we met there i and she one with the other all alone and we were blithe yet memory saddens those hours as when the moon looks upon daylight and with her i stoopd to drink the spring water athirst where other waters sprang and where the echo is she sang my soul another echo there but when that hour my soul won strength for words whose silence wastes and kills dull raindrops smote us and at length thunderd the heat within the hills that eve i spoke those words again beside the pelted window pane and there she hearkend what i said with under glances that surveyd the empty pastures blind with rain next day the memories of these things like leaves through which a bird has flown still vibrated with loves warm wings till i must make them all my own and paint this picture so twixt ease of talk and sweet long silences she stood among the plants in bloom at windows of a summer room to feign the shadow of the trees and as i wrought while all above and all around was fragrant air in the sick burthen of my love it seemd each sun thrilld blossom there beat like a heart among the leaves o heart that never beats nor heaves in that one darkness lying still what now to thee my loves great will or the fine web the sunshine weaves for now doth daylight disavow those days nought left to see or hear only in solemn whispers now at night time these things reach mine ear when the leaf shadows at a breath shrink in the road and all the heath forest and water far and wide in limpid starlight glorified lie like the mystery of death last night at last i could have slept and yet delayd my sleep till dawn still wandering then it was i wept for unawares i came upon those glades where once she walkd with me and as i stood there suddenly all wan with traversing the night upon the desolate verge of light yearnd loud the iron bosomd sea even so where heaven holds breath and hears the beating heart of loves own breast where round the secret of all spheres all angels lay their wings to rest how shall my soul stand rapt and awd when by the new birth borne abroad throughout the music of the suns it enters in her soul at once and knows the silence there for god here with her face doth memory sit meanwhile and wait the days decline till other eyes shall look from it eyes of the spirits palestine even than the old gaze tenderer while hopes and aims long lost with her stand round her image side by side like tombs of pilgrims that have died about the holy sepulchre i when bishop berkeley said there was no matter and proved it twas no matter what he said they say his system tis in vain to batter too subtle for the airiest human head and yet who can believe it i would shatter gladly all matters down to stone or lead or adamant to find the world a spirit and wear my head denying that i wear it ii what a sublime discovery twas to make the universe universal egotism that alls ideal all ourselves ill stake the world be it what you will that thats no schism oh doubt if thou best doubt for which some take thee but which i doubt extremely thou sole prism of the truths rays spoil not my draught of spirit heavens brandy though our brain can hardly bear it iii for ever and anon comes indigestion not the most dainty ariel and perplexes our soarings with another sort of question and that which after all my spirit vexes is that i find no spot where man can rest eye on without confusion of the sorts and sexes of beings stars and this unriddled wonder the world which at the worsts a glorious blunder iv if it be chance or if it be according to the old text still better lest it should turn out so well say nothing gainst the wording as several people think such hazards rude theyre right our days are too brief for affording space to dispute what no one ever could decide and everybody one day will know very clearly or at least lie still v and therefore will i leave off metaphysical discussion which is neither here nor there if i agree that what is is then this i call being quite perspicuous and extremely fair the truth is ive grown lately rather phthisical i dont know what the reason is the air perhaps but as i suffer from the shocks of illness i grow much more orthodox vi the first attack at once provd the divinity but that i never doubted nor the devil the next the virgins mystical virginity the third the usual origin of evil the fourth at once establishd the whole trinity on so uncontrovertible a level that i devoutly wishd the three were four on purpose to believe so much the more vii to our theme the man who has stood on the acropolis and lookd down over attica or he who has saild where picturesque constantinople is or seen timbuctoo or hath taken tea in small eyd chinas crockery ware metropolis or sat amidst the bricks of nineveh may not think much of londons first appearance but ask him what he thinks of it a year hence viii don juan had got out on shooters hill sunset the time the place the same declivity which looks along that vale of good and ill where london streets ferment in full activity while everything around was calm and still except the creak of wheels which on their pivot he heard and that bee like bubbling busy hum of cities that boil over with their scum ix i say don juan wrappd in contemplation walkd on behind his carriage oer the summit and lost in wonder of so great a nation gave way tot since he could not overcome it and here he cried is freedoms chosen station here peals the peoples voice nor can entomb it racks prisons inquisitions resurrection awaits it each new meeting or election x here are chaste wives pure lives her people pay but what they please and if that things be dear tis only that they love to throw away their cash to show how much they have a year here laws are all inviolate none lay traps for the traveller every highways clear here he was interrupted by a knife with damn your eyes your money or your life xi these free born sounds proceeded from four pads in ambush laid who had perceivd him loiter behind his carriage and like handy lads had seizd the lucky hour to reconnoitre in which the heedless gentleman who gads upon the road unless he prove a fighter may find himself within that isle of riches exposd to lose his life as well as breeches xii juan who did not understand a word of english save their shibboleth god damn and even that he had so rarely heard he sometimes thought twas only their salam or god be with you and tis not absurd to think so for half english as i am to my misfortune never can i say i heard them wish god with you save that way xiii juan yet quickly understood their gesture and being somewhat choleric and sudden drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture and fired it into one assailants pudding who fell as rolls an ox oer in his pasture and roard out as he writhd his native mud in unto his nearest follower or henchman oh jack im floord by that ere bloody frenchman xiv on which jack and his train set off at speed and juans suite late scatterd at a distance came up all marvelling at such a deed and offering as usual late assistance juan who saw the moons late minion bleed as if his veins would pour out his existence stood calling out for bandages and lint and wishd he had been less hasty with his flint xv perhaps thought he it is the countrys wont to welcome foreigners in this way now i recollect some innkeepers who dont differ except in robbing with a bow in lieu of a bare blade and brazen front but what is to be done i cant allow the fellow to lie groaning on the road so take him up ill help you with the load xvi but ere they could perform this pious duty the dying man cried hold ive got my gruel oh for a glass of max weve missd our booty let me die where i am and as the fuel of life shrunk in his heart and thick and sooty the drops fell from his death wound and he drew ill his breath he from his swelling throat untied a kerchief crying give sal that and died xvii the cravat staind with bloody drops fell down before don juans feet he could not tell exactly why it was before him thrown nor what the meaning of the mans farewell poor tom was once a kiddy upon town a thorough varmint and a real swell full flash all fancy until fairly diddled his pockets first and then his body riddled xviii don juan having done the best he could in all the circumstances of the case as soon as crowners quest allowd pursud his travels to the capital apace esteeming it a little hard he should in twelve hours time and very little space have been obligd to slay a free born native in self defence this made him meditative xix he from the world had cut off a great man who in his time had made heroic bustle who in a row like tom could lead the van booze in the ken or at the spellken hustle who queer a flat who spite of bowstreets ban on the high toby spice so flash the muzzle who on a lark with black eyed sal his blowing so prime so swell so nutty and so knowing xx but toms no more and so no more of tom heroes must die and by gods blessing tis not long before the most of them go home hail thamis hail upon thy verge it is that juans chariot rolling like a drum in thunder holds the way it cant well miss through kennington and all the other tons which make us wish ourselves in town at once xxi through groves so called as being void of trees like lucus from no light through prospects namd mount pleasant as containing nought to please nor much to climb through little boxes framd of bricks to let the dust in at your ease with to be let upon their doors proclaimd through rows most modestly calld paradise which eve might quit without much sacrifice xxii through coaches drays chokd turnpikes and a whirl of wheels and roar of voices and confusion here taverns wooing to a pint of purl there mails fast flying off like a delusion there barbers blocks with periwigs in curl in windows here the lamplighters infusion slowly distilld into the glimmering glass for in those days we had not got to gas xxiii through this and much and more is the approach of travellers to mighty babylon whether they come by horse or chaise or coach with slight exceptions all the ways seem one i could say more but do not choose to encroach upon the guide books privilege the sun had set some time and night was on the ridge of twilight as the party crossd the bridge xxiv thats rather fine the gentle sound of thamis who vindicates a moment too his stream though hardly heard through multifarious dammes the lamps of westminsters more regular gleam the breadth of pavement and yon shrine where fame is a spectral resident whose pallid beam in shape of moonshine hovers oer the pile make this a sacred part of albions isle xxv the druids groves are gone so much the better stonehenge is not but what the devil is it but bedlam still exists with its sage fetter that madmen may not bite you on a visit the bench too seats or suits full many a debtor the mansion house too though some people quiz it to me appears a stiff yet grand erection but then the abbeys worth the whole collection xxvi the line of lights too up to charing cross pall mall and so forth have a coruscation like gold as in comparison to dross matchd with the continents illumination whose cities night by no means deigns to gloss the french were not yet a lamp lighting nation and when they grew so on their new found lantern instead of wicks they made a wicked man turn xxvii a row of gentlemen along the streets suspended may illuminate mankind as also bonfires made of country seats but the old way is best for the purblind the other looks like phosphorus on sheets a sort of ignis fatuus to the mind which though tis certain to perplex and frighten must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten xxviii but londons so well lit that if diogenes could recommence to hunt his honest man and found him not amidst the various progenies of this enormous citys spreading spawn twere not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his yet undiscoverd treasure what i can ive done to find the same throughout lifes journey but see the world is only one

former husband that old disaster is now just funny so laugh we do in what cyril connolly has called the endless nocturnal conversation of marriage which may be the best part darling must i love you in light verse without the tribute of profoundest art of course it wont last you will break my heart or i yours by dying i could weep over that but now it seems forced here in these heaven hills the mourning doves mourning the squirrels mating my old cat warm in my lap here on our terrace as from below comes a musical cursing as you mend my favorite plate later of course i could pick a fight there is always material in that but we dont come from fighting people those who scream out red hot iambs in their hate no love the heavy poem will have to come from temps perdu fertile with pain or perhaps detonated by terrors far beyond this place where the world rends itself and its tainted waters rise in the east to erode our safety here much as i want to gather a lifetime thrift and craft my cunning skills tied in a knot for you there is only this useless happiness as gift many in aftertimes will say of you he loved her while of me what will they say not that i loved you more than just in play for fashions sake as idle women do even let them prate who know not what we knew of love and parting in exceeding pain of parting hopeless here to meet again hopeless on earth and heaven is out of view but by my heart of love laid bare to you my love that you can make not void nor vain love that foregoes you but to claim anew beyond this passage of the gate of death i charge you at the judgment make it plain my love of you was life and not a breath my letters all dead paper mute and white and yet they seem alive and quivering against my tremulous hands which loose the string and let them drop down on my knee to night this said he wished to have me in his sight once as a friend this fixed a day in spring to come and touch my hand a simple thing yet i wept for it this the papers light said dear i love thee and i sank and quailed as if gods future thundered on my past this said i am thine and so its ink has paled with lying at my heart that beat too fast and this o love thy

energy an innocence unfrightened of itself that shook the lakes waters and unsettled the strained composures and appointed certainties of whatever absolute speaker had been ranting in my brain peace through strength justice must be ours so many demon faces in the glass city each pubic triangle seemed under the bathing suits to grow electrical and crackle with a sexual shock that made me turn my face away and who should be there but you my dear lord of misrule blowing smoke in all our faces the clean bullet hole in your forehead above your self ironic smile dont let the monkeys stop typing and after i swam and i was sitting on the bank after the boy and his parents had packed up and gone home i played the noh play over for you in the tape loop of the void where your voice and laughter so casually reside how the mother gone searching for her missing son finds him dancing by the lake and as she tries to hold him he slips through her arms just as she slips through his arms and as she cries out in perfect pitch in perfect time to the shrieking bamboo flute that her boy has drowned she understands that she too has drowned that she too is a ghost returning to dance as they dance together in a tighter and tighter round pitiful brother the dreadful nights i owed him ive got no real involvement in the business i toyed with his weakness so it was my fault we wound up back in exile and enslavement he saw me as a loser a weird child he added his own prods i answered my satanic doctor jeering and made it out the window all down a landscape crossed by unheard of music i spun my dreams of a nighttime wealth to come after that more or less healthy pastime id stretch out on a pallet and almost every night soon as i slept my poor brother would rise dry mouth and bulging eyes the way hed dreamt himself and haul me into the room howling his stupid dream truly convinced id vowed to take him back to his primal state child of the sun and so we wandered fed on wine from the caves and gypsy bread me bound to find the place itself and the code why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds oertake me in my way hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my storm beaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offences cross ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds tis true tis day what though it be o wilt thou therefore rise from me why should we rise because tis light did we lie down because twas night love which in spite of darkness brought us hither should in despite of light keep us together light hath no tongue but is all eye if it could speak as well as spy this were the worst that it could say that being well i fain would stay and that i loved my heart and honour so that i would not from him that had them go must business thee from hence remove oh thats the worst disease of love the poor the foul the false love can admit but not the busied man he which hath business and makes love doth do such wrong as when a married man doth woo i was enriched not casting after marvels but as one walking in a usual place without desert but common eyes and ears no recourse but to hear power but to see got to love you of grace subtle musicians that could body wind or contrive strings to anguish in conceit random and artless strung a branch with bells fixed in one silver whim which at a touch shook and were sweet and you you lovely and unpurchased note one run distraught and vexing hot and cold to give to the hearts poor confusion tongue by chance caught you and henceforth all unlearned repeats you gold as freedom is a breakfastfood or truth can live with right and wrong or molehills are from mountains made long enough and just so long will being pay the rent of seem and genius please the talentgang and water most encourage flame as hatracks into peachtrees grow or hopes dance best on bald mens hair and every finger is a toe and any courage is a fear long enough and just so long will the impure think all things pure and hornets wail by children stung or as the seeing are the blind and robins never welcome spring nor flatfolk prove their world is round nor dingsters die at break of dong and commons rare and millstones float long enough and just so long tomorrow will not be too late worms are the words but joys the voice down shall go which and up come who breasts will be breasts thighs will be thighs deeds cannot dream what dreams can do time is a tree this life one leaf but love is the sky and i am for you just so long and long enough my love who shelters in his wordssometimes falls silent for a sudden eternitybreathes that silence into a bell of glassin which he calms stormshe draws lee lines in what wasits more like a firefirm cracklingwhen he takes up words with easein a single glance caressing my bodyi read him day and night what will it be likewhen he withdraws into the word old arranges a last room silver white pushes the furniture a bit closer togetherand crams still more fragile glass inside what will it be like when he grows transparent and breaks just for this evening lets not mock them not their curtsies or cross garters or ever recurring pepper trees in their gardens promising promising at least they had ideas about love all day weve driven past cornfields past cows poking their heads through metal contraptions to eat weve followed west and what else irrigation sprinklers fly past us huge wooden spools in the fields lounging sheep telephone wires yellowing flowering shrubs before us above us the clouds swell layers of them the violet underneath of clouds every idea i have is nostalgia look up there is the sky that passenger pigeons darkened and filled darkened for days eclipsing sun eclipsing all other sound with the thunder of their wings after a while it must have seemed that they followed not instinct or pattern but only one another when they stopped audubon observed they broke the limbs of stout trees by the weight of the numbers and when we stop well follow what our hearts the puritans thought that we are granted the ability to love only through miracle but the troubadours knew how to burn themselves through how to make themselves shrines to their own longing the spectacular was never behind them think of days of those scarlet breasted blue winged birds above you think of me in the garden humming quietly to myself in my blue dress a blue darker than the sky above us a blue dark enough for storms though cloudless at what point is something gone completely the last of the sunlight is disappearing even as it swells just for this evening wont you put me before you until im far enough away you can believe in me then try try to come closer my wonderful and less than loot my point of view hove my heart free from its hived booth though i know your smoke its black blossom is a substance ill never become colors of plaster and grass ive prepped flawlessly rivers ive whittled thin its a personal matter to me the wind but let it be our cathedral feeling a sculpture of ash dragging its robe over the hills because of us because of me yellow is hurried but red moves like a swarm through toothpick homes pans over roofs where the ethos we child from the ground will blacken to ruin lets glory this roughened nap of landscape this parched arcadia with one nude struck match and a breeze its common to live properly to pretendyou dont feel heat or grief wave nightly at miss fugue and mister goggles before divinginto your nightcap before reading yourself a bedtime story or watching your beloved sinkto the bottom of a lake and noting his absence in your log the next day you drop his clothes offat goodwill like a sack of mail from a warplane then hobble back to your hovel like a knight movingonly in ls it is comfortable to be alive this way especially now but it makes you so vulnerable to shock you ignore the mortgage and find a falconers glove in your yard whole hand still inside or you arrive homeafter a long day to discover your children have grown suddenly hideous and unlovable what im tryingto say is i think its okay to accelerate around corners to grunt back at the mailman and swallow allyour laundry quarters so much of everything is dumb baffle water puts out fire my diseases can becomeyour diseases and two hounds will fight over a feather because feathers are strange all i want is to finallytake off my cowboy hat and show you my jeweled horns if we slow dance i will ask you not to tugon them but secretly i will want that very much all day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened keep the whole house tormented he is trying to reach the bees he is after bees this is the climax an end to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders last june on the porch floor i found them dead a sprinkle of dusty bugs and next day a still worse death until like falling in love bee haunted i swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch i thought sickened and sickening me from what origin my life centered on bees all floors were suspect the search was hopeless windows were shut i never find where anything comes from but in june my husbands fierce sallies began inspections cracks located and sealed insecticides shot outside the bees course watched charted books on bees read i tell you i swept up bodies every day on the porch then theyd stop the problem was solved then they were there again as the feelings make themselves known again as they beseech sleepers who live innocently in will and mind it is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers that the bees were back no surprise to me but they had left themselves so lack luster their black and gold furs so deathly faded gray bugs that the broom hunted were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch of heart takes place or a great shift of season november it came to an end no bees and i could watch the floor clean and cool and from windows the cold land but this spring the thing began again and his curse went upstairs again and his tinkering and reasoning and pride it is the man who takes hold i lived from bees but his force went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid and now in july he is tearing out the wall and each board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand it is quiet has been quiet for a while he calls me and i march from a dream of bees to see them winged and unwinged such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers dirty clots of grubs sawdust stuck fliers all smeared together with old honey they writhe some of them but who cares they go to the garbage it is over everything has been said but there is more wouldnt you think the bees had suffered enough this evening we go to a party the breeze dies late we are sticky in our old friendships and light headed we tell our funny story about the bees at two in the morning we come home and a friend a scientist comes with us in his car were going to save the idea of the thing a hundred bees if we can find so many unrotted still warm but harmless and leave the rest we hope that the neighbors are safe in bed taking no note of these private catastrophes he wants an enzyme in the flight wing muscle not a bad thing to look into in the night we rattle and raise the lid of the garbage can flashlights in hand we open newspapers and the men reach in a salve of happenings i cant touch it i hate the self examined whove killed the self the dead are darker but the others have moved in the ooze toward the next moment my god one half worm gets its wings right before our eyes searching fingers sort and lay bare they need the idea of bees and yet under their touch the craze for life gets stronger in the squirming whitish kind the men do it making a claim on the future as love makes a claim on the future grasping and i underhand i feel it start a terrible lifelong heave taking direction unpleading the men prod till all that grubby softness wants to give to give dear love for nothing less than thee would i have broke this happy dream it was a theme for reason much too strong for fantasy therefore thou wakdst me wisely yet my dream thou brokst not but continuedst it thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice to make dreams truths and fables histories enter these arms for since thou thoughtst it best not to dream all my dream lets act the rest as lightning or a tapers light thine eyes and not thy noise wakd me yet i thought thee for thou lovest truth an angel at first sight but when i saw thou sawest my heart and knewst my thoughts beyond an angels art when thou knewst what i dreamt when thou knewst when excess of joy would wake me and camst then i must confess it could not choose but be profane to think thee any thing but thee coming and staying showd thee thee but rising makes me doubt that now thou art not thou that love is weak where fears as strong as he tis not all spirit pure and brave if mixture it of fear shame honour have perchance as torches which must ready be men light and put out so thou dealst with me thou camst to kindle goest to come then i will dream that hope again but else would die this is the multitude the beasts you wanted to show me drawing me upstream all morning up through wind scoured heather to the hillcrest below us in the next glen is the grave calm brotherhood descended out of winter out of hunger kneeling like the signatories of a covenant their weighty antique polished antlers rising above the vegetation like masts in a harbor or city spires we lie close together and though the windwhips away our man and woman smell everystag face seems to look toward us toward but not to us were held and hold them in civil regard i suspect youd hoped to impress me to lift to my sight our shared country lead me deeper into what you know but loathto cause fear youre already moving quietly away sure ill go with you as i would now almost anywhere my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red than her lips red if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damasked red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground and yet by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare when americans say a man takes liberties they mean hes gone too far in philadelphia today i saw a kid on a leash look mom ward and announce his fondest wish one bicentennial burger hold the relish hold is forget in american on the courts of philadelphia the rich prepare to serve to fault the language is a game as well in which love can mean nothing doubletalk mean lie im saying doubletalk with me im saying go so far the customs are untold make nothing without words and let me be the one you never hold i know him that man walking toward me up the crowded street of the city i have lived with him seven years now i know his fast stride his windy wheatfield hair his hands thrust deep in his jacket pockets hands that have known my body touched its softest part caused its quick shudders and slow releasings i have seen his face above my face his mouth smiling moaning his eyes closed and opened i have studied his eyes the brown turning gold at the centers i have silently watched him lying beside me in the early morning i know his loneliness like mine human and sad but different too his private pain and pleasure i can never enter even as he comes closer past trees and cars trash and flowers steam rising from the manhole covers gutters running with rain he lifts his head he sees me we are strangers again and a rending music of desire and loss i dont know him courses through me and we kiss and say its good to see you as if we havent seen each other in years when it was just a few hours ago and we are shy then not knowing what to say next i swallow a pill but there is no cure a city map wont get me where i want to go scaling the scaffold mindless of the mall unaware of driveways where housewives dodge the wrecking ball i crawl outside these vacant blues and into the contours of your eyes horace iv i its over love look at me pushing fifty now hair like grave grass growing in both ears the piles and boggy prostate the crooked penis the sour taste of each days first lie and that recurrent dream of years ago pulling a swaying bead chain of moonlight of slipping between the cool sheets of dark along a body like my own but blameless what goods my cut glass conversation now now im so effortlessly vulgar and sad you get from life what you can shake from it for me its g and ts all day and cnn try the blond boychick lawyer entry level at eighty grand who pouts about overtime keeps evian and a beeper in his locker at the gym and hash in tinfoil under the office fern theres your hound from heaven with buccaneer curls and perfumed war paint on his nipples his answering machine always has room for one more slurred embarrassed call from you know who some nights ive laughed so hard the tears wont stop look at me now why now i long ago gave up pretending to believe anyones memory will give as good as it gets so why these stubborn tears and why do i dream almost every night of holding you again or at least of diving after you my long gone through the bruised unbalanced waves after the steaming bodies swept through the hungry streets of swollen cities after the vast pink spawning of family poisoned the rivers and ravaged the prairies after the gamble of latex and diaphragms and pills i invoked the white robes gleaming blades ready for blood and feeling the scourge of increase and multiply made affirmation yes deliver us from complicity and after the precision of scalpels i woke to a landscape of sunshine where the catbird mates for life and maps trace out no alibis stepped into a morning of naked truth where acts mean what they really are the purity of loving for the sake of love she could tell he loved her he wanted her there sitting in the front pew when he preached he liked to watch her putting up her hair and ate whatever she cooked and never broached the subject of the years before they met he was thoughtful always he let her say whether or not they did anything in bed and tried to learn the games she tried to play she could tell how deep his feeling ran he liked to say her name and bought her stuff for no good reason he was a gentle man how few there are she knew well enough he sometimes reached to flick away a speck of something on her clothes and didnt drum his fingers on the table when she spoke what would he do if he knew she had a dream sometimes slipping out of her nightgown if ever god forbid he really knew her to slip once out of the house and across town and find someone to talk dirty to her long before the fresh apple crisis my life had some form to it i would wake in the mornings i would perform something for example the day i tried as one with acute passion might to win one woman over but accidentally won another that whole time i had been living like someone though i cant remember his name his model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that i inhabit in time of need this time the need was surprising people tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk and apples take their shape naturally the guy whose name escapes me now taught me to look upon others concerns as mine to make at home i was fond of doing many things at home but my favorite was drinking juice when my friends came by they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands thinking they knew what i needed and planning to force it on me i had to tell them i was busy with my juice two weeks before the crisis i had been writing some poems about it it was a warm day not entirely different from other warm days in san francisco people were on the street pale people were on the street making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned the poems i had written were failures but dense ones it seemed appropriate to think the persons attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people i had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers cant help but enjoy that day i had in a sense gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them i awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something not anything life threatening but definitely personal my lover then wanted to spend much of her life asleep she had no ostensible reaction to the citys sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them in a world where a persons tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets i could not find four people who cared i thought that if i could find those four people we could really do something a few of my friends pretended they were chosen a few neighbors felt bad and made offers my mother called to console me my lover in actuality the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop slept next to me sleep became our network falling in and out of it for change the rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time so i kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness if by morning i could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing she would reward me before the crisis the reward would have needed only to be an apple one but after the apples were gone the landscape usually contains the solution to whats lost demographics help people in cars some people did not notice me some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me that was two days before the evening before it was two days before the crisis i was thinking that i did not think i was asleep i had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemates cat in it when i looked again there was no light but i had not been asleep its the way people react to traumatic events they say i had just been there or will say she was just with me so the loss of light was emotional and the lost state demographic i began to trace things by their disappearance alone in the room my memory and anticipated darkness going for light people like to talk about the daytime people in strange moods often miss the daytime before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods i had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste i was happy i mean i was in my juice five weeks before the crisis i was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house i did not really work there but i went there every week all but the third sunday of each month i would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale not to buy but to stand next to shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs that was one thing i would stand there and be something for taller people who couldnt see i had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed my parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere my father would always say if youre not going to be a people person then numbers will have to do he was surprised that with all the time i had on my hands i chose to spend most of it alone numbers then did hold some mystery for me but mostly too high and far reaching to explore for years i had known that if there was a wall between where i was and where i needed to be i did not want it there some people have personal goals that are demanding certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed my decision to drink only fresh juice which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast kept me busy rounding up cash i would have to leave most friendships behind as a way of keeping my life wall free i had to divide my time i would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories the second part of my day i would spend telling people about the first part the other parts are not of substance here twenty five years before the crisis i had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice twenty three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany i am always drinking in my poems a good friend says in the first years of my life everything i ate was mush today i will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this when i had that remarkable glass of apple juice i had no idea that one day i simply would not be able to find it the city gets rid of its apples people find themselves inventing fruit the day i decided to write poems about it it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage i had been resting in my best friends easy chair we were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me five days later i had twenty poems when a person writes a poem about her passions people on the street are bound to notice them the passions overwhelm the body she carries the body as though it were the book the friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week and though i miss her it was the failures that saved me on every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful if certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall the person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly in the alley behind the natural foods grocery i met my second lover for the first time meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present and the weather was so hot during the crisis only the alleys had shade forty eight days into the crisis while on a thirst strike i had to make a run for the alley not as though people were after me but the elements the foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need at the bottom of any body based need is grace when i appeared at the opening of the alley a woman who not twenty four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east side wall women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things i thought about telling her or short women make me want things all the time while i was growing up i put a lot of demands on my juice forty eight days into the crisis she made me forget it i did not forget it but was embroiled the newspapers were saying things about the past people were celebrating thick juice and i kept writing those poems that day in the alley i realized three things about life while assisting her i learned three things to carry around with me to disperse when needed for six months during the crisis i did not care about the crisis when my faith returned all my lovers were gone that morning i woke to the two hundred and thirty second day of the crisis i was beneath my bed it was the sixth day that i had awakened beneath my bed i was lonely but i was also sure life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character who when we passed on the street did not know me i knew it was me by the way my head felt people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it today all my ideas are liquid that day of my faith friends thinking i was sick came by to see me it would be the last day i spent alone i was happy but still would not drink the juice on my mind was no longer juice there was an absence there but one so constant it became familiar i did not want to drink it pale with the blue of high zeniths shimmered over with silver brocaded in smooth running patterns a soft stuff with dark knotted fringes it lies there warm from a womans soft shoulders and my fingers close on it caressing where is she the woman who wore it the scent of her lingers and drugs me a languor fire shotted runs through me and i crush the scarf down on my face and gulp in the warmth and the blueness and my eyes swim in cool tinted heavens around me are columns of marble and a diapered sun flickered pavement rose leaves blow and patter against it below the stone steps a lute tinkles a jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor a big bellied frog hops through the sunlight and plops in the gold bubbled water of a basin sunk in the black and white marble the west wind has lifted a scarf on the seat close beside me the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour she draws it more closely about her and it ripples beneath her slight stirring her kisses are sharp buds of fire and i burn back against her a jewel hard and white a stalked flaming flower till i break to a handful of cinders and open my eyes to the scarf shining blue in the afternoon sunshine how loud clocks can tick when a room is empty and one is alone the nightclubs neon light glows red with anxiety as i wait on the turning lane cars blur past their headlights white as charcoal i trust each driver not to swerve i trust each stranger not to kill me and let me cross the shadow of his smoky path trust is all i have for patrons at the bar one man offers me a line one man buys the kamikaze another drinks it yet another wraps his arm around my waist i trust him not to harm my body as much as he expects his body to remain unharmed one man asks me to the dance floor one asks me to a second drink another asks me home i dance i drink i follow i can trust a man without clothes naked he conceals no weapons no threat but the blood in his erection his bed unfamiliar only temporarily pillows without loyalty absorb the weight of any man betray the scent of the men who came before i trust a strangers tongue to tell me nothing valuable it makes no promises of truth or lies it doesnt swear commitments the strangers hands take their time exploring undisguised they do not turn to claws or pretend artistic skill to draw configurations on my flesh they are only human hands with fingertips unsentimental with discoveries without nostalgia for what they leave behind i trust this stranger not to stay inside me once he enters me i trust him to release me from the blame of pleasure the pain i exit with no greater than the loneliness that takes me to the bar he says good night i give him back those words taking nothing with me that is his the front door shuts behind me the gravel driveway ushers me away the rearview mirror loses sight of threshold house sidewalk street driving by the nightclub i pass a car impatient on the turning lane my hands are cold and itch to swerve the wheel to brand his fender with the fury of my headlights but i let this stranger live to struggle through the heat and sweat of false affections anonymous and borrowed like the glass that washed my prints to hold another patrons drink at last we parley we so strangely dumb in such a close communion it befell about the sounding of the matin bell and lo her place was vacant and the hum of loneliness was round me then i rose and my disordered brain did guide my foot to that old wood where our first love salute was interchanged the source of many throes there did i see her not alone i moved toward her and made proffer of my arm she took it simply with no rude alarm and that disturbing shadow passed reproved i felt the pained speech coming and declared my firm belief in her ere she could speak a ghastly morning came into her cheek while with a widening soul on me she stared death is careless at times it confuses love with a wet afternoon in an empty room the unpainted walls a reminder of how sex can resemble poverty a hollow cry an open mouth falling inside as you sleep i prepare my heart and language with better words like worlds in small selves ive built every month one dollar buys me one brick but how many bricks does it take to build a house a stray dog barks late at night i cant see him but know hes there he reminds me that here dreams have dangerous turns i turn around to no one naked beside me i play it safe not to see the fire in my hands but let us be clear im no beggar its just that there are times when the world is a sound that cripples the air and the soul when what seems arranged glazing and strange like music played on tin cans turns into wilting noise when suddenly all that exists is a small boy trying to focus on the pain lifting a nation a telephone call he was wearing black shoes a calvin klein t shirt that he found in a hotel trash brown slacks she was wearing one earring on her right ear one sock on her left foot a dress the color of sky she bought him a canne sucre he pulled her close said ti cherie and after they promised to meet later she winked and walked leisurely in the shade a tremble followed when he turned around her body was one of a thousand on the streets he ran towards her stood by her arm unable to see her face the call drops i begin to count the ways i tolerate my dry mouth to count the glasses of water i gave away to make up for my sins but this act does not count when we fall out of our hearts i cant tell you i had climbed for hours on ledges and crawled through gaps in the earth my hands negotiating through the teeth of the palisade lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies and i cant tell you that i came onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood the opposite end of root speaking for its entirety through silence and color and i wish i could tell you that at the moment i met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone your name appeared in my throat with clarity and i wish we were old and in front of a grand painting a picture or postcard of picassos

us never cured the sorrow yet chuse among the pretty fellows one of honor youth and wit vi prithee hear him every morning at least an hour or two once again at night returning i believe the dose will do under the trellised arbor and our suppers over in the memory ive found myself inside l not speaking and beside us the river sliding softly by now the light will fade to moonlit water and in memory i work to make this lingering accurate and sweet white ouzo and her hand that lifts the grapes first to her lips then to mine i may as well speak to moonlight as to her and the walls of bruges light up again a costume jewelry pearl string her profile and her shawl hugged tight against the breeze in memorys flammable celluloid flaring and gone replaced by bread and grapes a checkered tablecloth the two chairs stare each other down empty now upon which moonlight flickered all night the bread and grapes drip mist as dawn carves the morning with a chilly wind slicing away both moon and fog now someone without a name appears first the fevered hands dustdevil quick that grope for the food in vain then the pale light shows the open mouth and rippling throat white face on black water sparrow flock fast its spiraling path but the bread and grapes stay where they were their smell tormenting that famished ghost helpless to even lick away the dew that gathers on the grapes blue fluted sides of the wineglasses dawnlight everything dripping wet and the chairs stare at each other alone sometimes on the riverbank you can sense an odor of grapes or sex or memory it swirls through the moonlit grass and now wakes someone always mute someone without a body weaving also through the half lit grass the hoarse wail of someone who cannot speak who reaches out but cannot touch the grass and only the nostrils flare now the dawn will break late autumn cold to crave so endlessly the warmth the blood pulsing fingertip the body to embrace the pungent smells commingling to rise like breath and slither through the trees and tangle every branch in this unappeasable longing this endless lust for touch and smell which afflicts the dead the souls in the trees face the gathering light other times in the ground the rain torments them two feet of snow at my parents place in another season here the cicadas sing like christian womens choirs in a disused cotton mill belief is a kind of weather i havent seen proper snow for three years the new urban forest for native plants and birds will be splendid if the local cats dont kill the birds the problem is all my sympathies are with the cats the friendly disturbers are more endearing than what they disturb a trimaran called rd degree spinning around its cable in the channel thats how love is here and should be everywhere it seems so unserious or contentedly ironic its the kind of thing you either look through or ignore but youd be wrong the question isnt why is love so strange here its why did it feel normal somewhere else in quiet places the present is just gossip about the past the future is a critique of that all my best when the man behind the counter said you pay by the orifice what could we do but purchase them all ah sandy you were clearly the deluxe doll modish and pert in your plastic nurse whites official hostess to our halcyon days where you bobbed in the doorway of our dishabille apartment a block downwind from the stockyards holding court on the corroded balcony k and i passed hash brownies collecting change for the buildings monthly pool to predict which balcony would fall off next thats when k was fucking m and m was fucking j and even b and i threw down once on the glass speckled lawn adrift in the headlights of his el camino those were immortal times sandy coke wasnt addictive yet condoms prevented herpes and men were only a form of practice for the russian novel we foolishly hoped our lives would become now its a friday night sixteen years from there dont the best characters know better than to live too long my estranged husband house sits for a spoiled cockatoo while saving to buy his own place my lovers gone back to his gin and the farm team fianc e he keeps in new york what else to do but read frank ohara to my tired three year old when i put him to bed he mutters more sorry as he turns into sleep tonight i find you in a box i once marked the past well therapys good for some things sandy but whod want to forgive a girl like that frank says destroy yourself if you dont know deflated youre simply the smile that surrounds a hole i dont know anything a kiss on the forehead erases misery i kiss your forehead a kiss on the eyes lifts sleeplessness i kiss your eyes a kiss on the lips is a drink of water i kiss your lips a kiss on the forehead erases memory thyrsis a youth of the inspired train fair sacharissa lovd but lovd in vain like ph bus sung the no less amorous boy like daphne she as lovely and as coy with numbers he the flying nymph pursues with numbers such as ph bus self might use such is the chase when love and fancy leads oer craggy mountains and through flowry meads invokd to testify the lovers care or form some image of his cruel fair urgd with his fury like a wounded deer oer these he fled and now approaching near had reachd the nymph with his harmonious lay whom all his charms could not incline to stay yet what he sung in his immortal strain though unsuccessful was not sung in vain all but the nymph that should redress his wrong attend his passion and approve his song like ph bus thus acquiring unsought praise he catchd at love and filld his arm with bays o rose thou art sick the invisible worm that flies in the night in the howling storm has found out thy bed of crimson joy and his dark secret love does thy life destroy side by side through the streets at midnight roaming together through the tumultuous night of london in the miraculous april weather roaming together under the gaslight days work over how the spring calls to us here in the city calls to the heart from the heart of a lover cool to the wind blows fresh in our faces cleansing entrancing after the heat and the fumes and the footlights where you dance and i watch your dancing good it is to be here together good to be roaming even in london even at midnight lover like in a lovers gloaming you the dancer and i the dreamer children together wandering lost in the night of london in the miraculous april weather when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been receivd with plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for me that followd and else when i carousd or when my plans were accomplishd still i was not happy but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health refreshd singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light when i wanderd alone over the beach and undressing bathed laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming o then i was happy o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food nourishd me more and the beautiful day passd well and the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came my friend and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night in the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me and his arm lay lightly around my breast and that night i was happy unraveling velvet wave after wave driven by wind unwinding by storm by gravity thrown however heaving to reach you to find you ive striven undulant erosive blown or lying flat as glass for your falling clear down i cant swallow you so why have i felt ive reached you as two reflected stars surfaced lie near as if the skys close element is one in me where starfish cleave to stones if youre so far ive touched you i know but my rush subsides our meetings only leave desires fleeting trace every place i touch you changes shape shore lie down undo ill fill your thirsty bones with blue ill flood your every cave and well be one when last we parted thou wert young and fair how beautiful let fond remembrance say alas since then old time has stolen away full thirty years leaving my temples bare so has it perished like a thing of air the dream of love and youth now both are grey yet still remembering that delightful day though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair though i have suffered many years of pain since then though i did never think to live to hear that voice or see those eyes again i can a sad but cordial greeting give and for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer as when i loved thee young and fair when i take my scissors to your shirts i am frightened not that they will whimper but that they wont understand the violence i mean that kind of violence is the other side of love bright as a light saber and permanent as the angels swords above eden barring that couple with a final x that violence means a love strong as death once sie ist mein leben you said meaning me and i took those words personally and knocked upon the door of my heart until all its birds flooded to you in a rush like the iroquois i tugged on our peace pipe i wrote your name in smoke then went home with my pockets rolling in shining glass beads my pockets so rich with the coin of your country marc antonizes somehow it

would flawless jewels how can you know that i have bled the way and back biting the dust to wear your name the wound lies not in your infliction but in my expectations if love is like a dolls shoe the color of nascent snowthat laces over the ankle or the polychromatic beaded baby moccasins we saw lying in the museum drawerthat belonged to an infant from a sea tribe of seal hunters or the rutilant pink blossoms of the locust tree that bloomed in the dark while i slept dreaming of my arrival on a red eye wearing a long to the floor skirt not of a postulant but of a flower vendoror a woman

bargains pure product you are falling bloom bloom you got all sing dark you shine grown fat for love in the dark you are like a volcano with a sea of heat explode you are falling explode if i could hold light in my hand i would give it to you and watch it become your shadow down by the salley gardens my love and i did meet she passed the salley gardens with little snow white feet she bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree but i being young and foolish with her would not agree in a field by the river my love and i did stand and on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow white hand she bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs but i was young and foolish and now am full of tears this is the life i wanted and could never see for almost twenty years i thought that it was enough that real happiness was either unreal or lost or endless and that remembrance was as close to it as i could ever come and i believed that deep in the past buried in my heart beyond the depth of sight there was a kingdom of peace and so i never imagined that when peace would finally come it would be on a summer evening a few blocks away from home in a small suburban park with some children playing aimlessly in an endless light and a lake shining in the distance eventually sometime around the middle of your life theres a moment when the first imagination begins to wane the future that had always seemed so limitless dissolves and the dreams that used to seem so real float up and fade the years accumulate but they start to take on a mild human tone beyond imagination like the sound the heart makes pouring into the past its hymns of adoration and regret and then gradually the moments quicken into life vibrant with possibility sovereign dense serene and then the park is empty and the years are still i think the saddest memory is of a kind of light a kind of twilight that seemed to permeate the air for a few years after id grown up and gone away from home it was limitless and free and of course i was going to change but freedom means that only aspects ever really change and that as the past recedes and the future floats away you turn into what you are and so i stayed basically the same as what id always been while the blond light in the trees became part of my memory and my voice took on the accents of a mind infatuated with the rhetoric of farewell and now that disembodied grief has gone away it was a flickering literary kind of sadness the suspension of a life between two other lives of continual remembrance between two worlds in which theres too much solitude too much disdain but the sadness that i felt was real sadness and this elation now a real tremor as the deepening shadows lengthen upon the lake this calm is real but how much of the real past can it absorb how far into the future can this peace extend i love the way the light falls over the suburbs late on these summer evenings as the buried minds stir in their graves the hearts swell in the warm earth and the soul settles from the air into its human home this is where the prodigal began and now his day is ending in a great dream of contentment where all night long the children sleep within tomorrows peaceful arms and the past is still and suddenly we turn around and smile at the memory of a vast inchoate dream of happiness now that we know that none of it is ever going to be dont you remember how free the future seemed when it was all imagination it was a beautiful park where the sky was a page of water and when we looked up there were our own faces shimmering in the clear air and i know that this life is the only real form of happiness but sometimes in its midst i can hear the dense stifled sob of the unreal one we might have known and when that ends and my eyes are filled with tears time seems to have stopped and we are alone in the park where it is almost twenty years ago and the future is still an immense open dream my body is like a jackfruit swinging on a tree my skin is rough my pulp is thick dear prince if you want me pierce me upon your stick dont squeeze ill ooze and stain your hands highway since you my chief parnassus be and that my muse to some ears not unsweet tempers her words to trampling horses feet more oft than to a chamber melody now blessed you bear onward blessed me to her where i my heart safe left shall meet my muse

out the spaces between the dark lines of the great unleaved to where the night is as clear as the day tell me was venus more beautiful than you are when she topped the crinkled waves drifting shoreward on her plaited shell was botticellis vision fairer than mine and were the painted rosebuds he tossed his lady of better worth than the words i blow about you to cover your too great loveliness as with a gauze of misted silver for me you stand poised in the blue and buoyant air cinctured by bright winds treading the sunlight and the waves which precede you ripple and stir the sands at my feet protruding rebelling against the lips the long pointed ill fated fang stared at me in spite of awkward attempts to hide it stealing adolescent glances i dreamed it pierced me pushing deep in the base of my neck i bit my lower lip flushed but not before blushing under its spell yesterday yesterday when he smiled at me with teeth in perfect alignment dentistry can work miracles i turned my apostate face and squinting pretended to watch passersby the sea is calm tonight the tide is full the moon lies fair upon the straits on the french coast the light gleams and is gone the cliffs of england stand glimmering and vast out in the tranquil bay come to the window sweet is the night air only from the long line of spray where the sea meets the moon blanched land listen you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling at their return up the high strand begin and cease and then again begin with tremulous cadence slow and bring the eternal note of sadness in sophocles long ago heard it on the gean and it brought into his mind the turbid ebb and flow of human misery we find also in the sound a thought hearing it by this distant northern sea the sea of faith was once too at the full and round earths shore lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled but now i only hear its melancholy long withdrawing roar retreating to the breath of the night wind down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of the world ah love let us be true to one another for the world which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams so various so beautiful so new hath really neither joy nor love nor light nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain and we are here as on a darkling plain swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night whose sense in so evil consort their stepdame nature lays that ravishing delight in them most sweet tunes do not raise or if they do delight therein yet are so cloyed with wit as with sententious lips to set a title vain on it o let them hear these sacred tunes and learn in wonders schools to be in things past bounds of wit fools if they be not fools who have so leaden eyes as not to see sweet beautys show or seeing have so wooden wits as not that worth to know or knowing have so muddy minds as not to be in love or loving have so frothy thoughts as easly thence to move or let them see these heavenly beams and in fair letters read a lesson fit both sight and skill love and firm love to breed hear then but then with wonder hear see but adoring see no mortal gifts no earthly fruits now here descended be see do you see this face a face nay image of the skies of which the two life giving lights are figured in her eyes hear you this soul invading voice and count it but a voice the very essence of their tunes when angels do rejoice oh come to me in dreams my love i will not ask a dearer bliss come with the starry beams my love and press mine eyelids with thy kiss twas thus as ancient fables tell love visited a grecian maid till she disturbed the sacred spell and woke to find her hopes betrayed but gentle sleep shall veil my sight and psyches lamp shall darkling be when in the visions of the night thou dost renew thy vows to me then come to me in dreams my love i will not ask a dearer bliss come with the starry beams my love and press mine eyelids with thy kiss i room after room i hunt the house through we inhabit together heart fear nothing for heart thou shalt find her next time herself not the trouble behind her left in the curtain the couchs perfume as she brushed it the cornice wreath blossomed anew yon looking glass gleamed at the wave of her feather ii yet the day wears and door succeeds door i try the fresh fortune range the wide house from the wing to the centre still the same chance she goes out as i enter spend my whole day in the quest who cares but tis twilight you see with such suites to explore such closets to search such alcoves to

garden why so wrong so flattening why not instead symbols of unchanging love yet pretty enough she considered arranging them in a vase with dry grass and last summers hydrangeas whose deadness was still how to put it alive or maybe the other side of life two sides really of the same thing she laughed a little such ideas were embarrassing even when kept to oneself but her train of thought carried her in its private tunnel through supper and at bedtime brushing her teeth she happened to look up at the moon its sunlit face was turned as always in her direction the full moon she couldnt help thinking though we see only half of it it was an insight she decided she could share with him but when he joined her and together they lay in the dark there seemed no reason to say anything the words in any case would be wrong would escape or disfigure her meaning good was the syllable she murmured to him fading into sleep and just for a split second teetering on the verge of it she believed everything that had to be was understood if you press a stone with your finger sir isaac newton observed the finger is also pressed by the stone but can a woman pressed by memorys finger in the deep night alone of her softness move the airy thing that presses upon her with the whole weight of love this sir isaac said nothing of the shirt touches his neck and smooths over his back it slides down

sportive to alight oh what is that in heaven where gray cloud flakes are seven where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt oh thats a meteor sent us a message dumb portentous an undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly their scent comes rich and sickly a scaled and hooded worm oh whats that in the hollow so

was ironic becausenot only was he a beast to women but his baby girls grewup seeking men like the father they barely saw unless they wentto his studio to be painted which wasnt ok with their motherswho were not only jealous but guilty of giving birth to girlswho were products of an x chromosome making monster would soon suffer at the hands of other monsters with x type sperm thereby assuring the continuation of suffering meanwhile all the girls became writers who slouchedfrom sitting at desks being daughters lovers of beasts chandelier too full of brilliance to be indolent your

looks in each bad dream what i see my god honey sweetheart i hold you against me but nothing works two boats moored rocking between nowhere nowhere a bone inside me whispersmaybe tonight but i keep thinking about the two men wrestling nude in lawrences women in love i cant get past reels of breath unwinding he has you now he doesnt he has you again now he doesnt youre at the edge of azaleas shaken loose by a word i see your rose colored skirt unfurl he has a knife to your throat night birds come back to their branches a hard wind raps at the door the new year prowling in a black overcoat its been six months since we made love tonight i look at you hugging the pillow half smiling in your sleep i want to shake you ask who again i touch myself unashamed until his face comes into focus hes stolen something from me i dont know if it has a name or not like counting your ribs with one foolish hand mine with the other when you show yourself to the woman you love you dont know your fearis not fear itself you have never been good but now you are so good who are you is it the liquidity of her skinthat bathes the world for you or her face captured like a she lionin your own flesh this summerbed is soft with ring upon ring upon ring of wedding the kindthat doesnt clink upon contact the kindwith no contract the kind in which the gold is only only light cloud covers and lifts and sleep and night and soon enough lovesbig fire laughs at a terrible burn but only only because pain absorbs excess joy and you shouldnt flaunt your treasures in front of all days eyes clora come view my soul and tell whether i have contrived it well now all its several lodgings lie composed into one gallery and the great arras hangings made of various faces by are laid that for all furniture youll find only your picture in my mind here thou are painted in the dress of an inhuman murderess examining upon our hearts thy fertile shop of cruel arts engines more keen than ever yet adorned a tyrants cabinet of which the most tormenting are black eyes red lips and curl d hair but on the other side thart drawn like to aurora in the dawn when in the east she slumbering lies and stretches out her milky thighs while all the morning choir does sing and manna falls and roses spring and at thy feet the wooing doves sit p rfecting their harmless loves like an enchantress here thou showst vexing thy restless lovers ghost and by a light obscure dost rave over his entrails in the cave divining thence with horrid care how long thou shalt continue fair and when informed them throwst away to be the greedy vultures prey but against that thou sitst afloat like venus in her pearly boat the halcyons calming all thats nigh betwixt the air and water fly or if some rolling wave appears a mass of ambergris it bears nor blows more wind than what may well convoy the perfume to the smell these pictures and a thousand more of thee my gallery do store in all the forms thou canst invent either to please me or torment for thou alone to people me art grown a numerous colony and a collection choicer far than or whitehalls or mantuas were but of these pictures and the rest that at the entrance likes me best where the same posture and the look remains with which i first was took a tender shepherdess whose hair hangs loosely playing in the air transplanting flowers from the green hill to crown her head and bosom fill most afternoons id run laps through parc brassens where grows the second smallest vineyard i have ever seen and where those silver pruned back stalks looked blunt strung out on wires and mostly dead all winter that was how i saw them thats all i expected even in the cold id see a guy my age there once a week playing his guitar hed sit next to the bench where id be stretching he rarely spoke just to ask if id like a song until the week before i left for good i was sitting at the top of a hill about a hundred feet away from where if you stand tiptoe you can see the eiffel tower he sat too close to me we spoke of many things then he suggested we go at it right there on the ground under the sun this is how one lives who knows that she will die rolling in the arms of anyone when she can rolling in the arms of a musician aware that no one cares much what we do in little knolls behind reedy forsythia in the middle of a tuesday in the middle of living and i would know now how he felt and the ground against me and whether he was rough or sweet and what is possible would widen every hour oh but me i thought i was immortal know celia since thou art so proud twas i that gave thee thy renown thou hadst in the forgotten crowd of common beauties livd unknown had not my verse exhald thy name and with it impd the wings of fame that killing power is none of thine i gave it to thy voice and eyes thy sweets thy graces all are mine thou art my star shinst in my skies then dart not from thy borrowd sphere lightning on him that fixd thee there tempt me with such affrights no more lest what i made i uncreate let fools thy mystic forms adore ill know thee in thy mortal state wise poets that wrappd truth in tales knew her themselves through all her veils at the midnight in the silence of the sleep time when you set your fancies free will they pass to where by death fools think imprisoned low he lies who once so loved you whom you loved so pity me oh to love so be so loved yet so mistaken what had i on earth to do with the slothful with the mawkish the unmanly like the aimless helpless hopeless did i drivel being who one who never turned his back but marched breast forward never doubted clouds would break never dreamed though right were worsted wrong would triumph held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better sleep to wake no at noonday in the bustle of mans work time greet the unseen with a cheer bid him forward breast and back as either should be strive and thrive cry speed fight on fare ever there as here the magic of numbers how strange it was to hear the furniture being moved around in the apartment upstairs i was twenty six and you were twenty two the magic of numbers you asked me if i wanted to run but i said no and walked on i was nineteen and you were seven the magic of numbers yes but does x really like us we were both twenty seven the magic of numbers you look like jerry lewis the magic of numbers grandfather and grandmother want you to go over to their house for dinner they were sixty nine and i was two and a half the magic of numbers one day when i was twenty nine years old i met you and nothing happened the magic of numbers no of course it wasnt i who came to the library brown eyes flushed cheeks brown hair i was twenty nine and you were sixteen the magic of numbers after we made love one night in rockport i went outside and kissed the road i felt so carried away i was twenty three and you were nineteen the magic of numbers i was twenty nine and so were you we had a very passionate time everything i read turned into a story about you and me and everything i did was turned into a poem when the beautiful young man drowned accidentally swimming at dawn in a current too swift for him or obedient to some cult of total immersion that promised the bather would come up divine mortality rinsed from him hadrian placed his image everywhere a marble antino s staring across the public squares where a few dogs always scuffled planted in every squalid little crossroads at the furthest corners of the empire what do we want in any body but the world and if the lovers inimitable form was nowhere then he would find it everywhere though the boy became simply more dead as the sculptors embodied him wherever hadrian might travel the beloved figure would be there first the turn of his shoulders the exact marble nipples the drowned face not really lost to the nile which has no appetite merely takes in anything without judgment or expectation but lost into its own multiplication an artifice rubbed with oils and acid so that the skin might shine which of these did i love here is his hair here his hair again here the chiseled liquid waist i hold because i cannot hold it if only one of you he might have said to any of the thousand marble boys anywhere would speak or the statues might have been enough the drowned boy blurred as much by memory as by water molded toward an essential remote ideal longing of course become its own object the way that desire can make anything into a god you can come to me in the evening with the fingers of former lovers fastened in your hair and their ghost lips opening over your body they can be philosophers or musicians in long coats and colored shoes and they can be smarter than i am whispering to each other when they look at us you can come walking toward my window after dusk when i cant see past the lamplight in the glass when the chipped plates rattle on the counter and the cinders dance on the cross ties under the wheels of southbound freights bring children if you want and the long wounds of sisters branching away behind you toward the sea bring your mothers tense distracted face and the shoulders of plane mechanics slumped in the naugahyde booths of the airport diner waiting for you to bring their eggs ill bring all the bottles of gin i drank by myself and my cracked mouth opened partway as i slept in the back of my blue impala dreaming of spiders i wont forget the lines running deeply in the cheeks of the polish landlady who wouldnt let the cops upstairs the missing ring finger of the machinist from spenard whose money i stole after he passed out to go downtown in a cab and look for whores or the trembling lower jaw of my son watching me back my motorcycle from his mothers driveway one last time the ribbons and cone shaped birthday hats scattered on the lawn the rain coming down like broken glass well go out under the stars and sit together on the ground and there will be enough to eat for everybody they can sleep on my couches and rug and the next day ill go to work stepping easily across the scaffolding feeding the cable gently into the new pipes on the roof and dreaming like st francis of the still dark rocks that disappear under the morning tide only to climb back into the light sea rimed salt blotched their patched webs of algae blazing with flies in the sun lady lovely lady careless and gay once when a beggar called she gave her child away the beggar took the baby wrapped it in a shawl bring her back the lady said next time you call hard by lived a vain man so vain and so proud he walked on stilts to be seen by the crowd up above the chimney pots tall as a mast and all the people ran about shouting till he passed a splendid match surely neighbours saw it plain although she is so careless although he is so vain but the lady played bobcherry did not see or care as the vain man went by her aloft in the air this gentle born couple lived and died apart water will not mix with oil nor vain with careless heart if endear is earned and is meant to identify two halves then it composes one meaning which means a token a knot a note a noting in the head of how it feels to have your heart be the dear one always the script the dramatic comma the pointed ellipsis half turn beat the exit itself as punctuation lets say the back wall of the house fell away first cracks down the plaster then it crumbles to reveal seventy five rows of spectators thats the explanation theyve been there all along i mulled blocking on a blind impulse but it turns out a correct one maybe someone is making love to me in the th century sense do i throw off his hand exit with pithy wit or simply submit to it the sappy moment which will i know have to be resisted in some later scene had i been there had it been me i would have said and the audience would have been moved to applaud astounding improvisation id have walked right up to the lawyer the bank manager and id have said or if it was me it would never have gotten that far id have turned to her and said so i am contemplating in its shade an apple tree havent i often done that so why not me late august the leaves like arrowheads dark green waxy punctuated by apples constellations of apples there i see the hunter bow pulled back the apples of his quiver fixed with perfect aim william tell daughter across the tree of apples herself poised with a perfect fruit above her head wet tension of its surface red skin that kisses the sun and this perfect tree this perfect tree in which every stamen was touched by pollen in which every flower thickened to fruit tree that knows by its own example perfection in each cluster five apples bunch as tight as chambers of a human heart had i been there had it been me and the slither up the trunk brought my attention low the rippling body sliding along the trunk i who have been so good all these years at resisting and giving in and resisting id have heard the melodious hiss seen the glinting tongue its fork invading the region of my heart the archer in that perfect canopy aiming right at me i who have given in to desire when the stakes were much lower could i resist those movements how fully the serpents hiss gives itself over to simile i am like i am like i am like seen it before mister id have sighed in an aside glanced up at the sky deadpanned the audience and said or had my lover brought the apple for years i have told them not to burn money on me but to bring only this to hold it out with a silent smile as they enter the house down center on the stage of the palm no better way to say i love you so why not me early october the outsize hunger after running and my lover brings it over i recognize on his breath the scent of the serpent and the apple the one forbidden thing deep voice dark eyes silent smile and perfect apple only midday draped across his body tight alert alive to the moment of sin and reaching out to take it in my hand who better than me let the tension linger let the audience pulse with anticipation we touch over the forbidden fruit the stage lights dim and i look at him and i look at him and raise my eyebrows and say but even so wouldnt i end up here again always here angels crossing swords behind me shame clothing me conflating all my losses the loss of god the loss of apples how they expand inside to fill up hunger maybe there are no words here just the sky blackening with anger maybe words wouldnt be useful here anyway consider a scrim the night sky blotted of constellations nothing but gray swirls of wrath and project against it a mans silhouette head bent empty handed the memory of apples imprinted on his wordless tongue and around his neck loss like a cowbell announcing his presence to the fallen world im glad youre positive im glad youre positive too though of course i wish you werent i wish you werent either is the response i expect and you say nothing and who can blame you not me im not the one wholl call you after dinner and a movie youre not the one wholl call me we both know we have that what that ultimate date one night to come one bright morning who can blame us not the forks and not

brought you to church well dressed and clad my god must have my best evn all i had lovely enchanting language sugar cane honey of roses wither wilt thou fly hath some fond lover ticed thee to thy bane and wilt thou leave the church and love a sty fie thou wilt soil thy broidered coat and hurt thyself and him that sings the note let foolish lovers if they will love dung with canvas not with arras clothe their shame let folly speak in her own native tongue true beauty dwells on high ours is a flame but borrowed thence to light us thither beauty and beauteous words should go together yet if you go i pass not take your way for thou art still my god is all that ye perhaps with more embellishment can say go birds of spring let winter have his fee let a bleak paleness chalk the door so all within be livelier than before my love alas i must not call you mine but to your envyd bride that name resign i must forget your lovely melting charms and be for ever banisht from your arms for ever oh the horror of that sound it gives my bleeding heart a deadly wound while i might hope although my hope was vain it gave some ease to my unpittyd pain but now your hymen doth all hope exclude and but to think is sin yet you intrude on every thought if i but close my eyes methinks your pleasing form besides me lies with every sigh i gently breath your name yet no ill thoughts pollute my hallowd flame tis pure and harmless as a lambent fire and never mingled with a warm desire all i have now to ask of bounteous heaven is that your perjuries may be forgiven that she who you have with your nuptials blest as shes the happiest wife may prove the best that all our joys may light on you alone then i can be contented to have none and never wish that you shoud kinder be than now and then to cast a thought on me and madam though the conquest you have won over my strephon has my hopes undone ile daily beg of heaven he may be kinder to you than he has been to me come live with me and we will sit upon the rocks by shallow rivers come live with me and we will plant acorns in each others mouth it would be our way of greeting the earth before it shoves us back into the snow our interior cavities brimming with disagreeable substances come live with me before winter stops to use the only pillow the sky ever sleeps on our interior cavities brimming with snow come live with me before spring swallows the air and birds sing last night as half asleep i dreaming lay half naked came she in her little shift with tilted glass and verses on her lips narcissus eyes all shining for the fray filled full of frolic to her wine red lips warm as a dewy rose sudden she slips into my bed just in her little shift said she half naked half asleep half heard with a soft sigh betwixt each lazy word oh my old lover do you sleep or wake and instant i sat upright for her sake and drank whatever wine she poured for me wine of the tavern or vintage it might be of heavens own vine he surely were a churl who refused wine poured out by such a girl a double traitor he to wine and love go to thou puritan the gods above ordained this wine for us but not for thee drunkards we are by a divine decree yea by the special privilege of heaven foredoomed to drink and foreordained forgiven ah hafiz you are not the only man who promised penitence and broke down after for who can keep so hard a promise man with wine and woman brimming oer with laughter o knotted locks filled like a flower with scent how have you ravished this poor penitent i joy to see how in your drawen work your selfe unto the bee ye doe compare and me unto the spyder that doth lurke in close awayt to catch her unaware right so your selfe were caught in cunning snare of a deare for and thralled to his love in whose streight bands ye now captived are so firmely that ye never may remove but as your whole worke is woven all about with woodbynd flowers and fragrant enlantine so sweet your prison you in time shall prove with many deare delights bedecked fyne and all thensforth eternall peace shall see betweene the spyder and the gentle bee i have studied the tight curls on the back of your neck moving away from me beyond anger or failure your face in the evening schools of longing through mornings of wish and ripen we were always saying goodbye in the blood in the bone over coffee before dashing for elevators going in opposite directions without goodbyes do not remember me as a bridge nor a roof as the maker of legends nor as a trap door to that world where black and white clericals hang on the edge of beauty in five oclock elevators twitching their shoulders to avoid other flesh and now there is someone to speak for them moving away from me into tomorrows morning of wish and ripen your goodbye is a promise of lightning in the last angels hand unwelcome and warning the sands have run out against us we were rewarded by journeys away from each other into desire into mornings alone where excuse and endurance mingle conceiving decision do not remember me as disaster nor as the keeper of secrets i am a fellow rider in the cattle cars watching you move slowly out of my bed saying we cannot waste time only ourselves no one can draw fast enoughto capture the cutiris before its form fallsfrom its former self but when we passed a patchin the ditch she told me to stop and she steppeddown opening her claspknife she spared one iriswith an impressionisticcocoon on its stemand cut the flower beside it once homeshe rendered in a careful hurry she drew into the night as the iris died i woke grafted to herin a vague translucent hammock of dread then came the darker sooner came the later lower we were no longer a sweeter here happily ever after we were after ever we were farther and further more was the word we used for harder lost was our standard bearer our gods were fallen faster and fallen larger the day was duller duller was disaster our charge was error instead of leader we had louder instead of lover never and over this river broke the winters black weather leaves flare up kitchen matches in the permanent trees black flash of pike on mirror lake dropping like a roll of nickels i dont want nudes in paintings i dont want beauty through the heart small harpoon that opens when pulled out i want to break another eggroll with you in moonlight ugly maples when youre gone first snow i release her into it i know released she wont come back this is different from letting what already we count as lost go it is nothing like that also it is not like wanting to learn what losing a thing we love feels like oh yes i love her released she seems for a moment as if some part of me that almost i wouldnt mind understanding better is that not love she seems a part of me and then she seems entirely like what she is a white dog less white suddenly against the snow who wont come back i know that and knowing it i release her its as if i release herbecause i know sometimes with one i love i fill myself with rage for fear i effuse unreturnd love but now i think there is no unreturnd love the pay is certain one way or another i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not returnd yet out of that i have written these songs i grieve and dare not show my discontent i love and yet am forced to seem to hate i do yet dare not say i ever meant i seem stark mute but inwardly do prate i am and not i freeze and yet am burned since from myself another self i turned my care is like my shadow in the sun follows me flying flies when i pursue it stands and lies by me doth what i have done his too familiar care doth make me rue it no means i find to rid him from my breast till by the end of things it be supprest some gentler passion slide into my mind for i am soft and made of melting snow or be more cruel love and so be kind let me or float or sink be high or low or let me live with some more sweet content or die and so forget what love ere meant my lute awake perform the last labour that thou and i shall waste and end that i have now begun for when this song is sung and past my lute be still for i have done as to be heard where ear is none as lead to grave in marble stone my song may pierce her heart as soon should we then sigh or sing or moan no no my lute for i have done the rocks do not so cruelly repulse the waves continually as she my suit and affection so that i am past remedy whereby my lute and i have done proud of the spoil that thou hast got of simple hearts thorough loves shot by whom unkind thou hast them won think not he hath his bow forgot although my lute and i have done vengeance shall fall on thy disdain that makest but game on earnest pain think not alone under the sun unquit to cause thy lovers plain although my lute and i have done perchance thee lie wethered and old the winter nights that are so cold plaining in vain unto the moon thy wishes then dare not be told care then who list for i have done and then may chance thee to repent the time that thou hast lost and spent to cause thy lovers sigh and swoon then shalt thou know beauty but lent and wish and want as i have done now cease my lute this is the last labour that thou and i shall waste and ended is that we begun now is this song both sung and past my lute be still for i have done remember when you love from that same hour your peace you put into your lovers power from that same hour from him you laws receive and as he shall ordain you joy or grieve hope fear laugh weep reason aloof does stand disabled both to act and to command oh cruel fetters rather wish to feel on your soft limbs the galling weight of steel rather to bloody wounds oppose your breast no ill by which the body can be pressed you will so sensible a torment find as shackles on your captived mind the mind from heaven its high descent did draw and brooks uneasily any other law than what from reason dictated shall be reason a kind of innate deity which only can adapt to evry soul a yoke so fit and light that the control all liberty excels so sweet a sway the same tis to be happy and obey commands so wise and with rewards so dressed that the according soul replies im blessed well this is nothing new nothing to rattle the rafters in the noggin this moment of remembering and its kissing cousin the waking dream i wonder if ill remember it ive had a vision of a woman reclining underneath a tree shes about half naked and little by little im sprinkling her burial mounds with grass this is the kind of work i like it lets me remember and so i do i remember the time i laid my homemade banjo in the fire and let it burn there was nothing else to burn and the house was cold the cigar box curled inside the flames but the burst of heat was over soon and once the little roar was done i could hear the raindrops plopping up the buckets and kettles scattered out like little ponds around the room it was night and i was a boy alone and left to listen to that old music i liked it ive liked it ever since i loved the helpless people i loved thats what a little boy will do but a grown man will turn it all to sadness and let it soak his heart until he wrings it out and dreams about another kind of love some afternoon beneath a tree burial mounds thats hilarious the wallful of quoted passages from his work with the requisite specimens pinned next to their literary cameo appearances was too good a temptation to resist and if the curator couldnt why should we the prose dipped and shimmered and the flies as i heard a buff call them stood at lurid attention on their pins if you love to read and look you could be happy a month in that small room one of the nabokov photos id never seen hes writing left handed why did i never trouble to find out at his stand up desk in the hotel apartment in montreux the pictures mostly of his back and the small wedge of face that shows brims with indifference to anything not on the page the windows shut a tiny lamp trails a veil of light over the page too far away for us to read we also liked the chest of specimen drawers labeled as if for apprentice freudians genitalia wherein languished in phials the thousands he examined for his monograph on the lycaenidae the silver studded blues and there in the center of the room a carillon of blues rang mutely out there must have been three hundred of them amandas blue was there and the chalk hill blue the karner blue lycaeides melissa samuelis nabokov a violet tinged copper the mourning cloak an echo azure the white lined green hairstreak the cretan argus known only from mt ida in the series nabokov did on this beauty he noted for each specimen the altitude at which it had been taken and as the ads and lovers say and much much more the stilled belle of the tower was a lycaeides melissa melissa no doubt its an accident melissa rhymes sort of with lolita the scant hour we could lavish on the blues flew by and we improvised a path through cars and slush and boot high berms of mud blurred snow to wherever we went next i must have been mute or whatever i said won from silence nothing it mourned to lose i was back in that small room vast by love of each flickering detail each genital dusting to nothing the turn like a worms or caterpillars of each phrase i stood up to my ankles in sludge pooled over a stopped sewer grate and thought wouldnt you know it about love and art you can be ruined rurnt as we said in south western ohio by a book or improved by a butterfly you can dodder in the slop septic with a rage not for order but for the love the senses bear for what they do for detail thats never annexed like a reluctant crumb to a vacuum cleaner to a coherence you can be bead after bead on perceptions rosary this is the sweet ache that hurts most the way desire burns bluely at its phosphorescent core just as youre having what you wanted most you want it more and more until thats more than you or it or both of you can bear i why should you sweare i am forsworn since thine i vowd to be lady it is already morn and twas last night i swore to thee that fond impossibility ii have i not lovd thee much and long a tedious twelve houres space i must all other beauties wrong and rob thee of a new imbrace could i still dote upon thy face iii not but all joy in thy browne haire by others may be found but i must search the blank and faire like skilfull minerallists that sound for treasure in un plowd up ground iv then if when i have lovd my round thou provst the pleasant she with spoyles of meaner beauties crownd i laden will returne to thee evd sated with varietie flashing in the grass the mouth of a spider clung to the dark of it the legs of the spider held the tucked wings close held the abdomen still in the midst of calling with thrusts of phosphorescent light when i am tired of being human i try to remember the two stuck together like burrs i try to place them central in my mind where everything else must surround them must see the burr and the barb of them there is courtship and there is hunger i suppose there are grips from which even angels cannot fly even imagined ones luciferin luciferase when i am tired of only touching i have my mouth to try to tell you what in your arms is not erased the nightingale as soon as april bringeth unto her rested sense a perfect waking while late bare earth proud of new clothing springeth sings out her woes a thorn her song book making and mournfully bewailing her throat in tunes expresseth what grief her breast oppresseth for tereus force on her chaste will prevailing o philomela fair o take some gladness that here is juster cause of plaintful sadness thine earth now springs mine fadeth thy thorn without my thorn my heart invadeth alas she hath no other cause of anguish but tereus love on her by strong hand wroken wherein she suffering all her spirits languish full womanlike complains her will was broken but i who daily craving cannot have to content me have more cause to lament me since wanting is more woe than too much having o philomela fair o take some gladness that here is juster cause of plaintful sadness thine earth now springs mine fadeth thy thorn without my thorn my heart invadeth who are you to tell us how to live or why et cetera no man of course and not so tall as is the current fashion nor smart enough in the acceptable modern way to enthrall the crowd with stories of my life among the savages where i was home and growing baffled day by day raging through the night as if it were new music i made groaing it came to me today at lunch the sound of women in the next booth a voice like aunt odiles whom i never knew well nor did i like her but not her spite but her voice like home grown fame a touch gravelly a considerable groan itself it seemed they spoke outmoded french around me never to me except to taunt i thought she leaned above me on those visits speaking to mother in their private french laughing a boy surrounded by the sound of foreign tongues knowing what wasnt meant for him toy temptations suggestive coils of syllables i learned latin for mass and did love its terrific laddered randomness the blessed hovering virgin above every station of a boys new path hormonal disharmonies her praises sung into hundreds the first tuesday of every month and yet latin could not expose such shreds of glittering flesh as i found in french not like the living tongue whose tip twined into an uncles mustache as he leered at the wrong aunt and winked and a fine distance crystallized loud there then gone crashing like german fathers family spoke clear english among the bayous boys and girls of immigrants accentless happily german through two wars not counting civil i had the tongue for arithmetic and spoke it beautifully i loved to count precisions a tempting career clicking into a future like an abacus ignoring all those accents around i never learned the luck of any but english bland and bound but only yesterday i heard a word the mechanic said in czech to his cousin shop rag clearly centered in a welter of incomprehension the wreck of my car at their wretched mercies shop rag and he wiped his hands and cried for me shrugging like a cousin would i wrote a check i drove home or tried so does it count am i a man of passion or child of comprehension father of little lusts driving myself home who thinks buy some sentiment a little like love and she must speak french this time she longs for you you know it isnt just the money america loves you for yourself alone and so i go for professional help honey blond hair and a disposition like a happy banker whose french for dear sounds like dog the cost of living is going up loving her here we rise from the snow where weve lain on our backs and flown like children from the imprint of perfect wings and cold gowns and we stagger together wine breathed into town where our people are building their armies again short years after body bags after burnings there is a man ive come to love after thirty and we have our rituals of coffee of airports regret after love we smoke and sleep with magazines two shot glasses and the black and white collapse of hours in what time do we live that it is too late to have children in what place that we consider the various ways to leave there is no list long enough for a selective service card shriveling under a match the prison that comes of it a flag in the wind eaten from its pole and boys sent back in trash bags well tell you you were at that time learning fractions well tell you about fractions half of us are dead or quiet or lost let them speak for themselves we lie down in the fields and leave behind the corpses of angels i wonder by my troth what thou and i did till we loved were we not weaned till then but sucked on country pleasures childishly or snorted we in the seven sleepers den twas so but this all pleasures fancies be if ever any beauty i did see which i desired and got twas but a dream of thee and now good morrow to our waking souls which watch not one another out of fear for love all love of other sights controls and makes one little room an everywhere let sea discoverers to new worlds have gone let maps to other worlds on worlds have shown let us possess one world each hath one and is one my face in thine eye thine in mine appears and true plain hearts do in the faces rest where can we find two better hemispheres without sharp north without declining west whatever dies was not mixed equally if our two loves be one or thou and i love so alike that none do slacken none can die new yeare forth looking out of janus gate doth seeme to promise hope of new delight and bidding thold adieu his pass if you undo your do you would be strange hair has been on my mind i used to lean in the doorway and watch my stony woman wind the copper through the black and play with my understanding show me she c uld take a cup of river water and watch it shimmy watch it change turn around and become ash bone wind in the cottonwoods wakes me to a day so thin its breastbone shows so paid out it shakes me free of its blue dust i will arrange that river water bottom juice i conjure my head in the stream and ride with the silk feel of it as my woman bathes me and shaves away the scorn sponges the grit of solitude from my skin laves the salt water of self esteem over my feathering body how like joy to come upon me in remembering a head of hair and the way water would caress it and stress beauty in the flair and cut of the only witness to my dance under sorrows tree this swift darkness is springs first hour i carried my life like a stone in a ragged pocket but i had a true weaving song a sly way with rhythm a healing tone my mind was once the true survey of all these meadows fresh and gay and in the greenness of the grass did see its hopes as in a glass when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me but these while i with sorrow pine grew more luxuriant still and fine that not one blade of grass you spyd but had a flower on either side when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me unthankful meadows could you so a fellowship so true forgo and in your gaudy may games meet while i lay trodden under feet when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me but what you in compassion ought shall now by my revenge be wrought and flowrs and grass and i and all will in one common ruin fall for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me and thus ye meadows which have been companions of my thoughts more green shall now the heraldry become with which i shall adorn my tomb for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me poor soul the centre of my sinful earth these rebel powers that thee array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end then soul live thou upon thy servants loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead theres no more dying then i miss the

scorn symbolism she needed a quarter to call her lover the docket was full shed be late for lunch and he gave her one it was not a taunt acquiescence wager or plea it was a quarter the fact that they had done this even this together and cordially late nights at the dining room table with a bottle of cabernet sharp pencils a love supreme and an e z workbook from the well reviewed the fact that theyd read reviews dont pay an attorney series as if they were learning portuguese or origami was not as if or like anything but just that a fact and not to be pressed for further significance this was part of the agreement they filled out the forms asked lawyer friends for language made stacks of books and towels cooked dinner together said excuse me passing in the hallway and even remembered each others mothers birthdays as if not as if waiting for their case to be called they got hungry the bailiff pointed toward the snack bar in the basement which was packed with a class trip from the school for the blind in illo tempore such a gift would have caused them to turn to each other in love and wonder now no they didnt even look to see she asked for fish sticks and he wondered if fish sticks were fish or like fish the children chewed their chicken fingers with calm deliberation staring out at what they saw then conveyed their limp paper plates with startling grace to the hinged swinging mouths of the trash cans which swallowed everything offered saying thank you thank you because she broke your heart shannons a badge a seven letter skidmark that scars up across your chest a flare of indelible script between death or glory and mama she rages scales the trellis of your rib cage her red hair swings down to bracket your ankles whip up the braid of your backbone cuff your wrists she keeps you sleepless with her afterimage and each pinned and martyred limb aches for more her memory wraps you like a vise how simple the pain that trails and graces the length of your body how it fans blazes writes itself over in the bloods tightening sighs bruises into wisdom you have no name for i have tried to say that although love is not judgement analysis too is a style of affect since the scale that rends me vulnerable has cut from abundance doubt not that identity shunts civic ratio or consequence sure i would prefer to respond to only the established charms and forget inconvenience but her hair was also a kind of honey or instrument all that is beautiful from which i choose even artifice which i hold above nature wont salve these stuttered accoutrements seeing in crowded restaurants the one you love you wave at the door tall girl in imperious fur and make for him bumping waiters dropping a glove arriving soft with affectionate slur as ladies half turn gazing

question of tempi slightly retarded a vertigo the viola suffers following the violins silence goes to sleep under every tree the cello drags gusts of confetti repetition emotion is all repetition pulled by twisted horsehair out of gut my dear dark dove a form of mourning that too is a form of repetition why dont you write so when those last days she has come at last with little otto

woman who spells poorly broad in the beam with thick knees and white stockings who reads romances who will die of cancer seven years later at and be buried in the jewish cemetery in p sek and i kissed you and you are sitting beside me and i am happy and at peace in such a way do the days pass for the angels no one scored the sleep rattle sunday august only then by his order zdenka is told and arrives by train these letters were written in fire with one black shadow at its feet the house thro all the level shines close latticed to the brooding heat and silent in its dusty vines a faint blue ridge upon the right an empty river bed before and shallows on a distant shore in glaring sand and inlets bright but aye mary made she moan and aye mary night and morn and ah she sang to be all alone to live forgotten and love forlorn she as her carol sadder grew from brow and bosom slowly down thro rosy taper fingers drew her streaming curls of deepest brown to left and right and made appear still lighted in a secret shrine her melancholy eyes divine the home of woe without a tear and aye mary was her moan madonna sad is night and morn and ah she sang to be all alone to live forgotten and love forlorn till all the crimson changed and past into deep orange oer the sea low on her knees herself she cast before our lady murmurd she complaining mother give me grace to help me of my weary load and on the liquid mirror glowd the clear perfection of her face is this the form she made her moan that won his praises night and morn and ah she said but i wake alone i sleep forgotten i wake forlorn nor bird would sing nor lamb would bleat nor any cloud would cross the vault but day increased from heat to heat on stony drought and steaming salt till now at noon she slept again and seemd knee deep in mountain grass and heard her native breezes pass and runlets babbling down the glen she breathed in sleep a lower moan and murmuring as at night and morn she thought my spirit is here alone walks forgotten and is forlorn dreaming she knew it was a dream she felt he was and was not there she woke the babble of the stream fell and without the steady glare shrank one sick willow sere and small the river bed was dusty white and all the furnace of the light struck up against the blinding wall she whisperd with a stifled moan more inward than at night or morn sweet mother let me not here alone live forgotten and die forlorn and rising from her bosom drew old letters breathing of her worth for love they said must needs be true to what is loveliest upon earth an image seemd to pass the door to look at her with slight and say but now thy beauty flows away so be alone for evermore o cruel heart she changed her tone and cruel love whose end is scorn is this the end to be left alone to live forgotten and die forlorn but sometimes in the falling day an image seemd to pass the door to look into her eyes and say but thou shalt be alone no more and flaming downward over all from heat to heat the day decreased and slowly rounded to the east the one black shadow from the wall the day to night she made her moan the day to night the night to morn and day and night i am left alone to live forgotten and love forlorn at eve a dry cicala sung there came a sound as of the sea backward the lattice blind she flung and leand upon the balcony there all in spaces rosy bright large hesper glitterd on her tears and deepening thro the silent spheres heaven over heaven rose the night and weeping then she made her moan the night comes on that knows not morn when i shall cease to be all alone to live forgotten and love forlorn ive carved a cave in the mountainside ive drilled for water stocked provisions to last a lifetime the walls are smooth we can live here love safe from elements well invent another love that cant destroy well make exquisite reproductions of our selves immortal on these walls and when this sea that cant support us is burned clean when the first new creatures crawl from it gasping for water air more wondrous and more wild than earths first couple they shall see there were two before them you and me my love once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his mind alas i was not careful and it struck your ringing anklets and came to grief it broke up into scraps of songs and lay scattered at your feet all my cargo of the stories of old wars was tossed by the laughing waves and soaked in tears and sank you must make this loss good to me my love if my claims to immortal fame after death are shattered make me immortal while i live and i will not mourn for my loss nor blame you come lets go in the ticket taker has shyly grinned and its almost time lovely one lets go in the wind tonights too wild the sky too deep too thin already its time the lights have dimmed come loveliest lets go in and know these bodies we do not have to own passing quietly as dreams as snow already leaves are falling and music begins lovely one its time lets go in the strings as if they knewthe lovers are about to meet beginto soar and when he marches in the doorthey soar some more half ecstasy half pain the musical equivalent of rain while children who have grown up with one staresteal further looks across a crowded room as goners tend to do my father loved it too warned me at dinner that hed be a wrecklong before the final trio came ja ja she sighed and gave him up forever he found his sophie better late than neverand took the fifth about his silent tearsbut like him im a softie with a massivegift for feeling blue i went with others threwbouquets and caution to the whirling wind believing that the rhapsody on stagewould waft its wonders up to our cheap seats but mirrors can be beautiful fierce cheats delusions of an over smitten mind i relished trouser roles until i hadno petals left to strew up down the avenuei wandered like a ghost i wondered whya miracle is always a mirage then plodded home and set back all the clocks spent hard won funds installing strong new locks telling myself if violence like thiscould never sound like violins i wouldto art not life be true and i am trying tofathom the way i got from there to here the joy that snuck up when id sworn off joy weve made a sterling start weve got a planto watch it on your satin couch downtownand ill be there upon the stroke of eight bearing in my trembling ungloved handa silver rose for you as the tide rises the closed mollusc opens a fraction to the oceans food bathed in its riches do not ask what force would do or if force could a knife is of no use against a fortress you might break it to pieces as gulls do no only the rising tide and its slow progress opens the shell lovers i tell you true you who have held yourselves closed hard against warm sun and wind shelled up in fears and hostile to a touch or tender word the ocean rises salt as unshed tears now you are floated on this gentle flood that cannot force or be forced welcome food salt as your tears the rich oceans blood eat rest be nourished on the tide of love as i am catholic i have never played ive had thirty six lovers plus tax i am the most chaste woman in italian literature i am completely asexual not counting errors and omissions mount sinai is sometimes confused with the mons veneris no one can know what is between me and god be music night that her sleep may go where angels have their pale tall choirs be a hand sea that her dreams may watch thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world be a voice sky that her beauties may be counted and the stars will tilt their quiet faces into the mirror of her loveliness be a road earth that her walking may take thee where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires o be a world and a throne god that her living may find its weather and the souls of ancient bells in a childs book shall lead her into thy wondrous house love is no more it died as the mind dies the pure desire relinquishing the blissful form it wore the ample joy and clarity expire regret is vain then do not grieve for what you would efface the sudden failure of the past the pain of its unwilling change and the disgrace leave innocence and modify your nature by the grief which poses to the will indifference that no desire is permanent in sense take leave of me what recompense or pity or deceit can cure or what assumed serenity conceal the mortal loss which we repeat the mind will change and change shall be relief lightning hits the roof shoves the knife darkness deep in the walls they bleed light all over us and your face the fan folds up so i wont see how afraid to be with me you are we dont mix even in bed where we keep ending up theres no need to hide it youre snow im coal ive got the scars to prove it but open your mouth ill give you a taste of black you wont forget for a while ill let it make you strong make your heart lion then ill take it back on the long shore lit by the moon to show them properly alone two lovers suddenly embraced so that their shadows were as one the ordinary night was graced for them by the swift tide of blood that silently they took at flood and for a little time they prized themselves emparadised then as if shaken by stage fright beneath the hard moons bony light they stood together on the sand embarrassed in each others sight but still conspiring hand in hand until they saw there underfoot as though the world had found them out the goose fish turning up though dead his hugely grinning head there in the china light he lay most ancient and corrupt and grey they hesitated at his smile wondering what it seemed to say to lovers who a little while before had thought to understand by violence upon the sand the only way that could be known to make a world their own it was a wide and moony grin together peaceful and obscene they knew not what he would express so finished a comedian he might mean failure or success but took it for an emblem of their sudden new and guilty love to be observed by when they kissed that rigid optimist so he became their patriarch dreadfully mild in the half dark his throat that the sand seemed to choke his picket teeth these left their mark but never did explain the joke that so amused him lying there while the moon went down to disappear along the still and tilted track that bears the zodiac love seeketh not itself to please nor for itself hath any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven in hells despair so sung a little clod of clay trodden with the cattles feet but a pebble of the brook warbled out these metres meet love seeketh only self to please to bind another to its delight joys in anothers loss of ease and builds a hell in heavens despite oh come my lad or go my lad and love me if you like i hardly hear the door shut or the knocker strike oh bring me gifts or beg me gifts and wed me if you will id make a man a good wife sensible and still and why should i be cold my lad and why should you repine because i love a dark head that never will be mine i might as well be easing you as lie alone in bed and waste the night in wanting a cruel dark head you might as well be calling yours what never will be his and one of us be happy theres few enough as is this to the crown and blessing of my life the much loved husband of a happy wife to him whose constant passion found the art to win a stubborn and ungrateful heart and to the world by tenderest proof discovers they err who say that husbands cant be lovers with such return of passion as is due daphnis i love daphnis my thoughts pursue daphnis my hopes and joys are bounded all in you even i for daphnis and my promise sake what i in women censure undertake but this from love not vanity proceeds you know who writes and i who tis that reads judge not my passion by my want of skill many love well though they express it ill and i your censure could with pleasure bear would you but soon return and speak it here the girl from the satellitetown holds berries in the

and two with the friendly phoenix the stars of orion the speaking pony and singing lion for in kalamazoo in a cottage apart lived the girl with the innocent heart thenceforth the city of kalamazoo was the envied intimate chum of the sun he rose from a cave by the principal street the lions sang the dawn horns blew and the ponies danced on silver feet he hurled his clouds of love around deathless colors of his old heart draped the houses and dyed the ground o shrine of the wide young yankee land incense city of kalamazoo that held in the midnight the priceless sun as a jeweller holds an opal in hand from the awkward city of oshkosh came love the bully no whip shall tame bringing his gang of sinners bold and i was the least of his oshkosh men but none were reticent none were old and we joined the singing phoenix then and shook the lilies of kalamazoo all for one hidden butterfly bulls of glory in cars of war we charged the boulevards proud to die for her ribbon sailing there on high our blood set gutters all aflame where the sun slept without any heat cold rock till he must rise again she made great poets of wolf eyed men the dear queen bee of kalamazoo with her crystal wings and her honey heart we fought for her favors a year and a day oh the bones of the dead the oshkosh dead that were scattered along her pathway red and then in her harum scarum way she left with a passing traveller man with a singing irishman went to japan why do the lean hyenas glare where the glory of artemis had begun of atalanta joan of arc cinderella becky thatcher and orphant annie all in one who burned this city of kalamazoo till nothing was left but a ribbon or two one scorched phoenix that mourned in the dew acres of ashes a junk mans cart a torn up letter a dancing shoe and the bones of

of doves my heart how im forced to fold my hands in prayer for another struck match barbed wires on rusted nails cant hold lone bulls at home when they smell pasture they thrust their bone skulls under barbs tongues quivering for a taste of strange and shove until the post gives way days later we find wires sagging reset the post and tighten bent wires like a fiddle and rope the worn out bull wishing there was only a fence between us and our hearts desire but something with spurs and a rope would find us cursing and yelling on horseback cutting us from escape down arroyos dragging us frothing and wild eyed back to the sun bleached yellow range the same whirlpool of buzzards see the chariot at hand here of love wherein my lady rideth each that draws is a swan or a dove and well the car love guideth as she goes all hearts do duty unto her beauty and enamourd do wish so they might but enjoy such a sight that they still were to run by her side through swords through seas whither she would ride do but look on her eyes they do light all that loves world compriseth do but look on her hair it is bright as loves star when it riseth do but mark her foreheads smoother than words that soothe her and from her arched brows such a grace sheds itself through the face as alone there triumphs to the life all the gain all the good of the elements strife have you seen but a bright lily grow before rude hands have touchd it ha you markd but the fall o the snow before the soil hath smutchd it ha you felt the wool o the beaver or swans down ever or have smelt o the bud o the briar or the nard in the fire or have tasted the bag of the bee oh so white oh so soft oh so sweet is she on the first day you were beautiful and goodon the second you grew a hornon the third a lead gray wing buddedfrom your shoulderon the fourth a claw sprouted from your shoeon the fifth you flewright into my armpitbuilt a nest and then lost intereston the sixth you were a host of leecheshaving their way with my veinson the seventh i heard youtrotting above me with hollow hoof beatson the eighth you went to moses to ask for advicewinged horned buraq the prophets steedreturned as a lamb on the ninthto graze on my belly furon the tenth you died for isaacthe angel decided in favor of animal testingon the eleventh i had forgotten the color of your eyeson the twelfth day you were poor and nakedon the thirteenth you were lying on the bottom of the seaa millions of eons old whispering musselon the fourteenth they called you into the fieldduldul alis tireless gray muleon the fifteenth you stood stillwelded on the lip of a kettlethe sweat of the holy brew had oxidized your copper neckon the sixteenth you were the primordial oxzarathustra sang of your sufferingon the seventeenth day when i came homeyou were once again the one human being were talking about when we met and you say it was easier to fall for me thinking ill remember this pause it was likely id be dead by now talking falling thinking waiting have i undone what youve tried to do you say no you say the surprise of still being is something being built the machine of our living this saltwork of luck stylish safe comfortable and unintended meanwhile i havent had the opportunity to tell you but our lovely little dog has just killed a possum maybe its unfair a possum entering the argument here but i lay it down before us because an ugly dying possum played dead and didnt run its dubious cunning was brought to an end outside our door by our brutal beautiful and very pleased little dog so how do i say that this is not about death or sadness or even whether you really first loved me waiting thinking id be dying young its just that standing there a few minutes ago holding a dead possum by its repellent bony tail i was struck by how eerily pleased i was to be a spectator to teeth spit agony and claw feeling full of purpose thinking how different in our adversaries we are from possums we try love the fist of words their opening hand and whether we play dead or alive our pain the slow circulation of happiness our salt and work the stubborn questions we endlessly give names to haunt us with choice the fountains mingle with the river and the rivers with the ocean the winds of heaven mix for ever with a sweet emotion nothing in the world is single all things by a law divine in one spirit meet and mingle why not i with thine see the mountains kiss high heaven and the waves clasp one another no sister flower would be forgiven if it disdained its brother and the sunlight clasps the earth and the moonbeams kiss the sea what is all this sweet work worth if thou kiss not me somewhere or other there must surely be the face not seen the voice not heard the heart that not yet never yet ah me made answer to my word somewhere or other may be near or far past land and sea clean out of sight beyond the wandering moon beyond the star that tracks her night by night somewhere or other may be far or near with just a wall a hedge between with just the last leaves of the dying year fallen on a turf grown green turning to watch you leave i see we must always walk towardother loves river of heavenbetween two office buildings orphaned cloud fish soup poppling book spined in the open palm unstoppable light i think it is all right or do tonight garden toada speaking stone young sound in an old heart annul the self i float it a day lily in my wine oblivion i love our lives keeping me from it the sovereign beauty which i do admire witness the world how worthy to be praised the light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire in my frail spirit by her from baseness raised that being now with her huge brightness dazed base thing i can no more endure to view but looking still on her i stand amazed at wondrous sight of so celestial hue so when my tongue would speak her praises due it stopped is with thoughts astonishment and when my pen would write her titles true it ravishd is with fancys wonderment yet in my heart i then both speak and write the wonder that my wit cannot endite twice or thrice had i lovd thee before i knew thy face or name so in a voice so in a shapeless flame angels affect us oft and worshippd be still when to where thou wert i came some lovely glorious nothing i did see but since my soul whose child love is takes limbs of flesh and else could nothing do more subtle than the parent is love must not be but take a body too and therefore what thou wert and who i bid love ask and now that it assume thy body i allow and fix itself in thy lip eye and brow whilst thus to ballast love i thought and so more steadily to have gone with wares which would sink admiration i saw i had loves pinnace overfraught evry thy hair for love to work upon is much too much some fitter must be sought for nor in nothing nor in things extreme and scattring bright can love inhere then as an angel face and wings of air not pure as it yet pure doth wear so thy love may be my loves sphere just such disparity as is twixt air and angels purity twixt womens love and mens will ever be you go from me in june for months on end to study equanimity among high trees alone i go out with a new boyfriend and stay all summer in the city where home mostly on my own i watch the sunflowers flare you travel east to help your relatives the rainy seasons start at least brings you from banishment and from the hall a doorway gives a glimpse of you writing i dont know what through winter with head bent in the lamps yellow spot to some fresh task some improvising skill your face is turned of which i ask nothing except the presence beneath white hair your clear eyes still are candid as the cats fixed narrowing gaze its pale blue incandescence in your room nowadays sociable cat without much noise or fuss we left the kitchen where he sat and suddenly we find he happens still to be with us in this room now though firmly faced away not to be left behind though all the night hell stray as you began youll end the year with me well hug each other while we can work or stray while we must nothing is or will ever be mine i suppose no one can hold a heart but what we hold in trust we do hold even apart im mapping this new years vanishings lover yellow house the knowledge of surfaces this is not a story of return there are times i wish i could erase the minds lucidity the difficulty of sundays my fervor to be touched by a woman two februarys gone what brings the body back grieved and cloven tromping these woods with nothing to confide in new snow reassumes the circleting trees the bridge above the creek where i stand like a stranger to my life there is no single moment of loss there is an amassing the disbeliever sleeps at an angle in the bed the orchard is a graveyard is this the real end someone shoveling her way out with cold intention someone naming her missing what should i say since faith is dead and truth away from you is fled should i be led with doubleness nay nay mistress i promised you and you promised me to be as true as i would be but since i see your double heart farewell my part though for to take it is not my mind but to forsake one so unkind and as i find so will i trust farewell unjust can ye say nay but you said that i alway should be obeyed and thus betrayed or that i wiste farewell unkissed nothing for days then a message i want to see a fight an old one so i bring a fight to you you know nothing of these men even the most famousget to slink in their youth again for you foreman is leviathan unstoppable ali just past his primeflown home to muscle back his title not sure how youll react to violencewe lie down again together your feet in woollen stockingskneadable across my thighs your mouth close to my ribsand their inmate a pouting lifer i fidget and you scold as ali opens up with right hand leadsyou flinchbut soon youre lost to the screenwhere he waits it out along the ropes takes everything foreman throws you dont believe he can soak upall this pain and go on standing we cheer him on winter softened in the tropic of his strength when ali comes alive to put foreman on the groundi see a hallelujah look as you turn to face me he won you say into my cheek he did i say i have carried my pillow to the windowsill and try to sleep with my damp arms crossed upon it but no breeze stirs the tepid morning only i stir come tease me a little with such cold passion so little teasing play how long can we endure our life together no use i put on your long dressing gown the untied sash trails over the dusty floor i kneel by the window prop up your shaving mirror and pluck my eyebrows i dont care if the robe slides open revealing a crescent of belly a tan thigh i can accuse that nonexistent breeze i am as monogamous as the north star but i dont want you to know it youd only take advantage while you are as fickle as spring sunlight all right sleep the cat means more to you than i i can rouse you but then you swagger out i glimpse you from the window striding toward the river when you return reeking of fish and beer there is salt dew in your hair where have you been your clothes werent that wrinkled hours ago when you left you couldnt have loved someone else after loving me i sulk and sigh dawdling by the window later when you hold me in your arms it seems for a moment the river ceases flowing we meet midway to walk white cobbles under a fish flesh gray sky europe is collapsing we are collapsingalways and again no matter how hardwe love one another i dont understand our failure where the feed loops back and spits us into another country another junior suite reenacting this same same beat of a scene that begins rises never ends always ends our intentions dont meet their courses set differently by a force you dont believe in could be as simple as life i want to be the wife you dont want you wont let go of my wrist i resist threaten bully acquiesce we write the next act of the alchemistin new york lisbon a beach a bar star crossed maybe from different galaxies you approach i retreat you retreat i reproach the manic two step jitters over north africas dunes farther than our hero santiago can see i rise in the night to find the sharp knifethat came with the pears as a courtesy first there was jim clamping to my long black hair that nine pound cleopatra wig with nylon bands and bobbie pins meanwhile i was on fire for chad who coached me a bit impatiently tuesday nights on my joan of arc inflection then terence said id be perfect for the lounge singer turned whore and as it turned out that was a fairly easy gig max signed me on soon after claiming i was a natural for eternally aggrieved girl which in hindsight hurts me deeply so by the time you followed me back to the green room to wait in the hallway whistling for my scrubbed face to emerge naturally i was wary waiting for the script you never bothered to come up with it was damned awkward sitting there nothing but milkshakes between us maybe i thought youd assumed i was the one with a script finally i decided to give terence a call i didnt like the way you looked at me so steadily with your chin resting on one fist as if the table were a table the boardsa floor listening there as if you meant it as if something i could say were true and every moment from now on would be my cue the woman stands on tiptoe to kiss the man and for a moment with their twin teal backpacks parkas and other gear they look like one new creature a mutation seated in la rosita their gear guards the table where they sip cafe con leche and lean forward sitting tall pelvises tilted forward to talk whisper their physical closeness almost embarrassing but to whom at this early hour light rivering in her chestnut hair their foreheads almost touching as they sit further forward straddling their chairs toes pressed down heels up wrists crossed a posture almost too intimate for a public space at breakfast but somehow right in the spanish caf she says that while it is absurd to sell forsythia it is a small miracle to buy cactus on th street and broadway if theyre strangers in manhattan they seem more at home than ive ever been they listen to the brisk chatter and clatter of plates and music from the spanish station which now plays yellow submarine universal language our friends are all aboard they study the menu and note the beautiful sounds words like huevos and arroz make for eggs and rice the generous syllabic count and vowel length seem like an echo for their love and their desire to linger other eyes are on them not only mine they have drawn the morning from a sea of newsprint in at least three languages toward their window seat the light changes along with the brisk pace of the walkers someone in a tan mackintosh reaches out to hail a yellow cab while the sun gilds the fire escapes and people rise energetically from their beds dont their eyes tire of each other or is it not the eyes that tire theyre not looking theyre drinking communicating through their skin several inches apart love cant be trusted but that doesnt mean it isnt real they linger over coffee he strokes the back of her neck she doesnt feel impelled to look up or stop but later she kisses him behind the ear and in the mountains there is snow melting to get down from the heights to pour through the clefts in the twisted rocks natural arches obstacles horseshoe shapes and in the plains there is a dropping of the shoulder armor a tingling in the hip sockets so that even a chance touch at the hipbone startles the center and starts a slow convulsion release of two creatures peculiarly perilously at odds used to training their gaze on the peripheries like this bicycle tethered to a parking meter orange handlebars silver trunk like a treasure chest perched not locked on a wrought iron ledge fixed over the chrome wheel casings blue shadow dappled twig littered canopies or the small tantalizing cursive c in the blue neon soft as silk announcing caf equense where the couple might return in the voluptuous dark the dark quietly vibrating like a mouth harp or her noiseless breathing or when they are lost in olmsteds misty labyrinthine rambles and framed by traffic they pause beside the lake in the dank air where the water is still another world from the blood running pavement the meat packing plants gray and dour below the rotting piers warped and will they be replaced with fresh wood or fazed out with poured concrete that knows no give or take no swelling what can love repair by what force of love can they imagine themselves beyond the squalor that surrounds them onto another plane blessed and blessing who invented ecstasy what man or woman first walked around with its burden cold shelter from the street among the bronze mailboxes inside the bright red freshly painted door jambs he picks her up under the buttocks she arches her thighs around his hips plants her feet on the tiles tongues firm yet tentative learning their own momentum the rubbery wall of her mouth takes him further in and in tongue and tongue freckle and freckle tears shuddering swelling in the places where they used to ache aint no cure knowing this touch this grave flicking of tongues could never be repeated or knowing it could knowing it in another consciousness he strokes her neck at the junction where the occipital bone and cervical spine cross engage spark coccyx tingles cock rises toward her not into her through her to her rises as he plies the inside of her ass and thighs or rubs the crevice where her right forefinger and thumb divide stroking her cheek or the hollow below her earlobe ankle bone clavicle tonguing every millimeter until sea dissolves into sky their raft turns over in warm water and they are that water and bob afloat buoyant at rest in secret knowledge of each others darknesses and now he could weep but there is no ice in the water where they would roil and tumble and where avenues welcome those who walk hand in hand gait easy backpacks half full half empty the sun coming out now as if synchronized to their desires and as the runners circle the reservoir they lower their eyes to adjust to the light bouncing off the water to ignite the cinders the green through the dead ice capped leaves a small curve an indent on the track gleams like a bracelet before an azure haze takes over it gets warm she has to peel her anorak she cups her hand over her eyes in the light and wind off the reservoir to see the easy arcs the gulls make as they spiral upward over the all angle roller coaster of the rooftops in the comforting thud of other feet as if lulled by the sound of a lovers heartbeat danger in distraction she must kick the chain link fence in order to set off again get back into the stream put her mind back into her body her body slender deceptive there is a power in it she has always known and feared or feared others would fear but its difficult with others always just how to say it necessary to hold some one thing back whom could she trust to let it out it might scare her scare him dawn a smudge of charcoal lifted by noon and his body as if heliotropic was drawn toward the flares of lilacs and now he knew to move cautiously keeping his eyes on the ground to not as he has done several times catch his foot on a stone or root cluster and fly off gashed hes relieved when night comes on he doesnt need his eyes to know swallows congregate on the stark bare limbs the darkness grows through the darkness of that winter tree soon they will be one and no one will see them for the first time i listen to a lost and secret recording of us making love near on ten years ago i recognize your voice your sounds though if i knew no better i could be any man in any room after the rising sounds of rising and of dressing and once as you step up close to the deck perhaps to pick up shoes you sing the chorus of sunday morning i call on you to hurry and we leave it does not end then the tape rolls on a few late cars which sigh by might have passed us walking away triumphant unaware weve left behind this mop and mow mechanism of silence to which we may never return methought i saw the grave where laura lay within that temple where the vestal flame was wont to burn and passing by that way to see that buried dust of living fame whose tomb fair love and fairer virtue kept all suddenly i saw the fairy queen at whose approach the soul of petrarch wept and from thenceforth those graces were not seen for they this queen attended in whose stead oblivion laid him down on lauras hearse hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed and groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce where homers spright did tremble all for grief and cursed the access of that celestial thief rose cheekd laura come sing thou smoothly with thy beautys silent music either other sweetly gracing lovely forms do flow from concent divinely framed heavn is music and thy beautys birth is heavenly these dull notes we sing discords need for helps to grace them only beauty purely loving knows no discord but still moves delight like clear springs renewd by flowing ever perfect ever in them selves eternal if thou must love me let it be for nought except for loves sake only do not say i love her for her smile her look her way of speaking gently for a trick of thought that falls in well with mine and certes brought a sense of pleasant ease on such a day for these things in themselves belov d may be changed or change for thee and love so wrought may be unwrought so neither love me for thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry a creature might forget to weep who bore thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby but love me for loves sake that evermore thou mayst love on through loves eternity only the manners of centuries ago can teach me how to address you my lover as who you are o sestius how could you put up with my children thinking all the while you were bearing me as in your mirror it doesnt matter anymore if spring wreaks its fiery or lamblike dawn on my new found asceticism some joke i wouldnt sleep with you or any man if you paid me and most of you poets dont have the cash anyway so please rejoin your fraternal books forever while you miss in your securest sleep ms rosy fingered dawn who mightve been induced to digitalize a part of you were it not for your self induced revenge of undoneness its good to live without a refrigerator why bother to chill the handiwork of ceres and of demeter and of the lonesome sappho lets have it warm for now with how sad steps o moon thou climbst the skies how silently and with how wan a face what may it be that even in heavnly place that busy archer his sharp arrows tries sure if that long with love acquainted eyes can judge of love thou feelst a lovers case i read it in thy looks thy languishd grace to me that feel the like thy state descries then evn of fellowship o moon tell me is constant love deemd there but want of wit are beauties there as proud as here they be do they above love to be lovd and yet those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess do they call virtue there ungratefulness motionless forgetful music of women and mentouching each forehead breathing a soul into each immeasurable other on earth where we are stranger through madness unattainableor grace in difficult traffic reaching for each immeasurable other no one on earth o bitterness o desire who commands the ships or who touching the lords shoulder and breathing a soul has measuredthis motionless forgetful music of women and men thusi behind the eye what sleeps must from the blind borrow this light though beauty be the mark of praise and yours of whom i sing be such as not the world can praise too much yet tis your virtue now i raise a virtue like allay so gone throughout your form as though that move and draw and conquer all mens love this s bjects you to love of one wherein you triumph yet because tis of yourself and that you use the noblest freedom not to choose against or faith or honors laws but who should less expect from you in whom alone love lives again by whom he is restored to men and kept and bred and brought up true his falling temples you have reared the withered garlands taen away his altars kept from the decay that envy wished and nature feared and on them burn so chaste a flame with so much loyalties expense as love t acquit such excellence is gone himself into your name and you are he the deity to whom all lovers are designed that would their better objects find among which faithful troop am i who as an offspring at your shrine have sung this hymn and here entreat one spark of your diviner heat to light upon a love of mine which if it kindle not but scant appear and that to shortest view yet give me leave t adore in you what i in her am grieved to want they caught them they were sitting at a table in the kitchen it was early they had on bathrobes they were drinking coffee and smiling she had one of his cigarillos in her fingers she had her legs tucked up under her in the chair they saw them through the window she thought of them stepping out of a bath and him wrapping cloth around her he thought of her waking up in a small white building he thought of stones settling into the ground then they were gone then they came in through the back her cat ran out the house was near the road she didnt like the cat going out they stayed at the table the others were out of breath the man and the woman reached across the table they were afraid they smiled the others poured themselves the last of the coffee burning their tongues the man and the woman looked at them they didnt say anything the man and the woman moved closer to each other the round table between them the stove was still on and burned the empty pot she started to get up one of them shot her she leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons she thought about being beside him being asleep they took her long grey socks put them over the barrel of a rifle and shot him he went back in his chair holding himself she told him hers didnt hurt much like in the fall when everything you touch makes a spark he thought about her getting up in the dark wrapping a quilt around herself and standing in the doorway she asked the men if they shot them again not to hurt their faces one of them lit him one of his cigarettes he thought what it would be like being children together he was dead before he finished it she asked them could she take it out of his mouth so it wouldnt burn his lips she reached over and touched his hair she thought about him walking through the dark singing she died on the table like that smoke coming out of his mouth ill go anywhere to leave you but come with me all the cities are like you anyway windows darken when i get close enough to see any place we want to stays polluted the good spots taken already by those who ruin them and restaurants wed never find wed rut a ditch by a river in nights so long they must be cut by the many pairs of wrong handled scissors maybe god owns and doesnt share i water god i make a haunted lake and rinse and rinse i take what i want and have ever since what i want disappeared like anything hunted thats what you said disappointment isnt tender dried and wide instead the tourists snapped you crying and the blanket i brought was so dirty it must have been lying around in lice and blood that whole year we fought it wasnt clear so i forgot i havent been sleeping next to you twitching to bury my boring eyes the ship made you sad and the ferry and canoe all boats do trying to see the proportional relation of one memory to another one is so strange and then to try and see what looms and doesnt for the other person who was there it gets stranger especially when youve read his email i dont know how people understand their lives measure their sensations against objective or so to speak democratic estimations whether people accept the externality of events events as things that happen to them i refuse to accept some coagulate of other peoples impressions in exchange for this privacy no matter how flawed it is this is lyric poetry it has to be it has no other hope what was it about you and me that made whatever happen to us in new york everything fell apart what i dreaded and expected but still tonight it is dark and the weather is cooler than its been it has taken a while for fall to break the global warming kept me in summer love with you like i was under a fermata now that the times are changing i feel even more for you or i feel nothing i cant tell its kind of scary i was sick of thinking about you this morning but i was listening to bob dylan and leonard cohen in order to think about you for literary purposes when i feel nothing for a person i get scared im losing my humanity and that turning cold means my hearts been botoxed were all fucked i watched a movie on youtube called ladies and gentlemen misterleonard cohen that was made when he was still just a poet and only famous in canada hes a pretentious little nerd in it self important teachers pet wit i think that making music he became so much nakeder much more desperate the talent real even pure evennatural had to ripen in the artificial man alain badiou on the day of his class said because an event is pure rapture an event disappears immediately it does not exist objectively but only by appearing and disappearing this is both precise and vague it is attractive i guess i guess since you and me did not disappear immediately it was not pure rapture not in these terms but my smile was real each time i swallowed your cum getting fucked by you was great i could feel it in my organs but you didnt make me go insane except for maybe once or twice actually maybe i am being unfair maybe the fucking really was that great in this moment i cant remember i just read a poetry review in which the reviewer states that a certain book made his cock feel as though it were tall as a tree thats nice i have no idea what it feels like to have a cock sometimes i feel as though im getting close to understanding and then something happens to make me have no clue again when sinan fucks me we lose our individuality so severely its like were both gasping after an animal thats his cock that is beyond us and i lose all sense of the world his cocks not even him and hes not him either and we arent anything its strange the possessive didnt thomas mann write a book called herrund hund or something like that mans best friend what belongs to him me and sunder talked about how scary and arousing it is to watch men masturbate cos everyone relates differently to his like dicks are always almost but never quite another je est un autre said that brat arthur rimbaud i am definitely in love with you as i write this you are so petty and superfluous i cannot stand you sinan is definitely in love with me i know because i saw him tonight i love him too you are gracious to accord me the space and time in which to develop or to elaborate upon as the french say these extreme emotions i am despite the odds and certain lapses so capable of feeling it was good to slap your face and to admit that your asshole made me nervous your eyes had a way of going soft and shiny when you said the really tender things we admitted it was intimidating for us both to hear each other describe people weve fucked and been in love with im proud of what we accomplished together alain badiou ended his class with a reading of ariane et barbe bleue which is an opera by paul dukas you and me had gone pretty far by the time this day came and something very fragile in me breaks when somebody says my name or even a variant of it i was tired i think badiou discusses ariane in being and event which i have not read in class he said that the story of the opera is about the relationship between law and freedom and that it shows that the desire for freedom is not so simple ariane experiences an event that causes her to demand freedom badiou said but she is unable to convince anybody else any other women to want freedom she ends up alone she genuinely falls in love with the wicked bluebeard at the beginning bluebeard who previously got women by having a castle to lock them in this woman ariane does not have to be taken by force when she enters his castle he hands her seven keys six of which he gives her permission to use and leaves she hears the cries of his other imprisoned wives coming from behind a door so she uses the forbidden key releasing them meanwhile bluebeard is assaulted by the local peasants who want to free ariane fearing her fate will turn out like that of the women who came before her but ariane is already free in herself and proves this freedom by bringing the wounded bluebeard home caring tenderly for him and then declaring that shes leaving him for good by the end bluebeards shattered sobbing bleeding ariane invites the other wives to leave with her in a wrenching aria pleading with them one by one to taste with her the freedom awaiting them the world but they all prefer confinement even though they had longed for freedom before ariane opened their door once liberty arrived they were no longer capable of it preferring to serve even a gutted hollowed out power ariane exits alone the end badiou narrated this with emotion and i cried maybe cos i was tired and that thing about my name or because i am not heroic or free i had missed half of alain badious lectures messing around with you on the couch by the fire in the womens toilets up on the hill if this were a suitable parable and it isnt i would try to tell myself that those very early mornings in brooklyn when i sat up in your bed feeling wrong and got dressed and walked away i should have stayed away cos i dont need you maybe i dont need you but i want you maybe i dont love you but i am getting to know you maybe what made me cry in class was how tired i was and how sad and hard it is and how rare to undertake an act thats truly free and not just a response to a confused surge of drives and fears harry loves myrtle he has strong arms from the warehouse and on sunday when they take the bus to emerald meadows he doesnt say what will your chastity amount to when your flesh withers in a little while no on sunday when they picnic in emerald meadows they look at the sunday paper girl slays banker betrayer they spread it around on the grass bath tub stirs jersey row and then they sit down on it nice harry doesnt say ziggins ointment for withered flesh cures thousands of men and women of moles warts red veins flabby throat scalp and hair diseases not expensive and fully guaranteed no harry says nothing at all he smiles and they kiss in the emerald meadows on the sunday paper of the gardens of adonis lydia i love most of all those fugitive roses that on the day they are born that very day must also die eternal for them the light of day theyre born when the sun is already high and die before apollos course across the visible sky

in that auspicious moment try with winning eloquence our peace implore and quiet to the weary world restore a round my neck an amu let be tween my eyes a star a ring in my nose and a gold chain to keep me where you are it seems i have always sat here watching men like you who turn heads whose gaze is always either a kiss or a slap or the whiplash of pure disregard why fret all youre doing is walking youre this years it the one righteous integer of cool cruising down a great lipped channel of hushed adoration women turned girls again brightening in spite of themselves that brave wilting smile you dont see it do you how she tells herself to move on blinks until she can the bright drop quivering on a thorn in the rich silence after rain lute music in the orchard aisles the paths ablaze with daffodils intrigue and venery in the air lombre des jeunes filles en fleurs the iron hand and the velvet glove come live with me and be my love a pearl face numinously bright shining in silence of the night a muffled crash of smouldering logs bad dreams of courtiers and of dogs the spanish ships around kinsale the screech owl and the nightingale the falcon and the turtle dove come live with me and be my love that which her slender waist confind shall now my joyful temples bind no monarch but would give his crown his arms might do what this has done it was my heavens extremest sphere the pale which held that lovely deer my joy my grief my hope my love did all within this circle move a narrow compass and yet there dwelt all thats good and all thats fair give me but what this ribbon bound take all the rest the sun goes round it should have a womans name something to tell us how the green skirt of land has bound its hips when the day lowers its vermilion tapestry over the west ridge the water has the sound of leaves shaken in a sack and the childs voice that you have heard below sings of the sea by slow movements of the earths crust or is it that her hip bones have been shaped by a fault of engineering some coquetry cycles this blue edge a spring ready to come forth to correct loves mathematics saturday rises immaculately the waters jade edge plays against corn colored picnic baskets rose and lemon bottles red balloons dancers in purple tights a roan mare out of its field it is not the moment to think of bahia and the gray mother with her water explanation not far from here the city a mass of swift water in its own depression licks its sores still i would be eased by reasons sand dunes in drifts lava cuts its own bed at a mountain base blindness enters where the light refuses to go in loch lomond the water flowers with algae and a small life has taken the name of a star you will hear my star slow heart empty itself with a light swift pitch where the water thins to a silence and the woman who will not be named screams in the birth of her fading away you smiled you spoke and i believed by every word and smile deceived another man would hope no more nor hope i what i hoped before but let not this last wish be vain deceive deceive me once again i went to the dances at chandlerville and played snap out at winchester one time we changed partners driving home in the moonlight of middle june and then i found davis we were married and lived together for seventy years enjoying working raising the twelve children eight of whom we lost ere i had reached the age of sixty i spun i wove i kept the house i nursed the sick i made the garden and for holiday rambled over the fields where sang the larks and by spoon river gathering many a shell and many a flower and medicinal weed shouting to the wooded hills singing to the green valleys at ninety six i had lived enough that is all and passed to a sweet repose what is this i hear of sorrow and weariness anger discontent and drooping hopes degenerate sons and daughters life is too strong for you it takes life to love life even if you didnt have green eyes in the bathtub blue even if you didnt have a lovely singing voice or care for alexandrine champagne some slow saturday evenings to sing it through it pleases me your lips close to my ear or when youre a big girl and im a big girl too five years difference between we two sometimes it hardly matters ive decided to worship you diana goddess of the forest or is she the one of the hunt who cares you remind me of her too some woman caught me up breathless in her strong arms said breathe darling her eyes were green blue vague resemblances thats the daily news meaning im willingly a fool for you any hour past midnight and almost anytime in three quarter view consider this too stumbling back after a fight to someplace we could call home you and i have been known to duet a jubilee so funky it sounds like the blues what steady arrows you shoot diana become a goddess of the hearth you whisper time to put the porchlight on and we do who am i talking to what is this strange glare this prescience that you wont be true sometimes you say something like even so boo and it sounds like breathe darling thats why this ones for you ive noticed after a few sips of tea the tip of her tongue thin and red with heat quickens when she describes her cuts and bruises deep violets and red the little girl i baby sit hair orange and wild sits splayed and upside down on a couch insists her giant book of dinosaurs is the only one shell ever read the night before i left him i could not sleep my eyes fixed on the freckles of his shoulder the glow of the clock my chest heavy with dread scientists say theyll force a rabbit to a bird a jellyfish with a snake even though the pairs clearly do not mix some things are not meant to be bred i almost forgot the weight of a man sitting beside me in bed sheets crumpled around our waists both of us with magazines laughing at the thing he just read he was so charming pointed out planets ghost galaxies an ellipsis of ants on the wall and when he kissed me goodnight my neck reddened im terrible at cards friends huddle in for euchre hearts beg me to play with them when its obvious i can clearly win with a black card i select a red i throw away my half finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket but my aim is no good the floor is scattered with fire hazards declarations unread go lovely rose tell her that wastes her time and me that now she knows when i resemble her to thee how sweet and fair she seems to be tell her thats young and shuns to have her graces spied that hadst thou sprung in deserts where no men abide thou must have uncommended died small is the worth of beauty from the light retired bid her come forth suffer herself to be desired and not blush so to be admired then die that she the common fate of all things rare may read in thee how small a part of time they share that are so wondrous sweet and fair i was the lonely one in whom they swarmed in the millions i was their creature and i was grateful i could sleep when i wanted i lived a divided existence in sleepdreams that lit up a silence as dreadful as that of the moon i have an overly precise recall of those solitary years before i opened the curtain and drew upon a universe of want that made me so strong i could crack spines of books with one hand ay gaze upon her rose wreathed hair and gaze upon her smile seem as you drank the very air her breath perfumed the while and wake for her the gifted line that wild and witching lay and swear your heart is as a shrine that only owns her sway tis well i am revenged at last mark you that scornful cheek the eye averted as you passd spoke more than words could speak ay now by all the bitter tears that i have shed for thee the racking doubts the burning fears avenged they well may be by the nights passd in sleepless care the days of endless woe all that you taught my heart to bear all that yourself will know i would not wish to see you laid within an early tomb i should forget how you betrayd and only weep your doom but this is fitting punishment to live and love in vain oh my wrung heart be thou content and feed upon his pain go thou and watch her lightest sigh thine own it will not be and bask beneath her sunny eye it will not turn on thee tis well the rack the chain the wheel far better hadst thou proved evn i could almost pity feel for thou art nor beloved i long to talk with some old lovers ghost who died before the god of love was born i cannot think that he who then lovd most sunk so low as to love one which did scorn but since this god producd a destiny and that vice nature custom lets it be i must love her that loves not me sure they which made him god meant not so much nor he in his young godhead practisd it but when an even flame two hearts did touch his office was indulgently to fit actives to passives correspondency only his subject was it cannot be love till i love her that loves me but every modern god will now extend his vast prerogative as far as jove to rage to lust to write to to commend all is the purlieu of the god of love o were we wakend by this tyranny to ungod this child again it could not be i should love her who loves not me rebel and atheist too why murmur i as though i felt the worst that love could do love might make me leave loving or might try a deeper plague to make her love me too which since she loves before iam loth to see falsehood is worse than hate and that must be if she whom i love should love me devouring time blunt thou the lions paws and make the earth devour her own sweet brood pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws and burn the long livd phoenix in her blood make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets and do whateer thou wilt swift footed time to the wide world and all her fading sweets but i forbid thee one more heinous crime o carve not with the hours my loves fair brow nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen him in thy course untainted do allow for beautys pattern to succeeding men yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong my love shall in my verse ever live young in a pyloned desert where the scorpion reigns my love and i plucked poppies breathing tales of crimes now long asleep whose once red stains dyed stabbing men at sea with bloody sails the golden sand drowsed there a dog yelped loud and in his cry rattled a hollow note of deep uncanny knowledge of that crowd that loved and bled in winy times remote the poppies fainted when the moon came wide the cur lay still our passionate review of red wise folly dreamed on she by my side stared at the moon and then i knew he knew and then he smiled at her to him twas funny her calm steel eyes her earth old throat of honey is an imaginary flower that never fades the amaranth is blue with black petals its yellow with red petals its enormous and grows into the shape of a girls house the seeds nestle high in the closet where she hid a boy the boy and his bike flee the girls parents from the tip of the leaves green summer light behind the veins the amaranth is an imaginary flower in the shape of a girls house dispensing gin and tonics from its thorns a succulent this makes the boys bike steer off course all summer following the girl in her marvelous car the drunken bike he was a small part of summer he was summers tongue my dear your eyes are weary rest them a little while assume the languid postureof pleasure mixed with guile outside the talkative fountaincontinues night and dayrepeating my warm passionin whatever it has to say the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebes very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears thus your soul ignitedby pleasures lusts and needssprays into heavens reachesand dreams of fiery deeds then it brims over dying and languorous apart drains down some slope and entersthe dark well of my heart the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebes very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears o you whom night enhances how sweet here at your breaststo hear the eternal sadnessof water that never rests o moon o singing fountain o leaf thronged night above you are the faultless mirrorsof my sweet bitter love the sheer luminous gown the fountain wears where phoebes very own color appears falls like a summer rain or shawl of tears they arrived at the desk of the hotel duncanand smithed in twitchy as flea drummed squirrels her coat was squared and cream his patent shoeswere little boats you wouldnt put to sea in people not meaning to write themselves into the soap that your life is rise or fall in the plot seems that they were fleeing from the smuch as a hummingbird flies from a flowers bell these were the times when wine was still a treat and not yet considered a common bodily fluid you will have heard that the mind works muchas an oval of soap turned between two hands she went round the room seeking lightsthat could be off without desire becoming love he spread his arms behind his head a gestureof libido she misread as test of temperature every carpet has its weave and underlay seen only by the maker the deliverer and the layer the year was a dog but the day was as good as a song that ends with a wedding meat on the rib evening was folding over the grid slick walkerswith armfuls of books splendored in dusks ask the song of the pipes was eerie as a face pressedto glass as a basketball with a mouth and teeth they lay in the glow of the times and talked ofhow people form a queue to exact or escape love each sigh has a sequel she thought then he did then the whole hotel pulsed through that thought scandal has an inroad but you must tunnel out she rose and stood up counting all hair and beauty though we do not hear them beneath our own our shadows footsteps clatter they match our dread mortal if thou art beloved lifes offences are removed all the fateful things that checked thee hearten hallow and protect thee growst thou mellow what is age tinct on lifes illumined page where the purple letters glow deeper painted long ago what is sorrow comforts prime loves choice indian summer clime sickness thou wilt pray it worse for so blessed balmy nurse and for death when thou art dying twill be love beside thee lying death is lonesome oh how brave shows the foot frequented grave heaven itself is but the casket for loves treasure ere he ask it ere with burning heart he follow piercing through corruptions hollow if thou art beloved oh then fear no grief from mortal men im having trouble understanding the wife the wife seems like she is only there as a foil to your actions i want to know how the wife feels when you drag her and your son down into the basement to start a new religion the religion has something to do with cowering before a force greater than yourself and then being buried alive i want to know how the wife behaves in small enclosed spaces if she is trying to comfort your son by telling him daddy likes to play funny games or if she is already visualizing herself walking into a womens shelter your son on her back and maybe because this is a fantasy she carries a burning torch like an angry villager or a goddess does the wife merit any revenge after you weed whack the coffee table does she agree with you that the coffee table is yours to destroy because you built it what has she built in the house that is hers to destroy what kind of childhood has the wife endured that allows her to understand you in her past life or lives was the wife ever a shepherdess does she see you as a sort of pan goatish and pricked by ticks but also very well endowed when the wife transforms into a tree can she still think or is she just a green haze inside an idea of growing i would like to see the wife peel off that bark leaving only enough for modestys sake although as this is your poem we can take a bit more off i want to see her uproot herself pick up the house and shake it how many people fall out the wife has something about her the germans would call unheimlich i sometimes catch a glimpse of the wife out of the corner of my eye but then i look away i cannot look directly at the wife the wife is a conflagration of everything dear i wonder sometimes if she is faking there is a certain note she holds too long so the orgasm is more operatic less genuine when she cries oh my god really she should stutter lets say the wife wakes up in the morning you have already made breakfast does your kindness feel oppressive does she want to take your weed whacker through the house has she ever in a fit of anger destroyed your pornography when you found a picture of the wife online with a foreign handprint smacked red on her ass how quickly did your shock turn to arousal are you aware the wife is breaking down in public places and sometimes cannot move for thirty minutes sometimes her arm goes entirely numb from the shoulder down i think the wife might need some fine tuning some elbow grease some wrenching apart and then reassembling they wont attack us here in the indian graveyard i love that moment and i love the moment when i climb into your warm you smelling bed dent after youve risen and sunflowers once a whole field and i almost crashed the next year all pumpkins crop rotation i love you dividing words between syl lables dachshunds what am i but the inter section of these loves i spend dollars on a cd of some guy with different guitars in his shack with lots of tape delays and loops a good buy mexican animal crackers but only to be identified by what you love is a malformation just as embryonic chickens grow very strange in zero gravity i hate those experiments on animals varnished bats blinded rabbits cows with windows in their flanks but obviously im fascinated perhaps it was my early exposure to frankenstein i love frankenstein arrgh he replies to everything fire particularly sets him off something the villagers quickly pick up fucking villagers all their shoutings making conversation impossible and now theres grit in my lettuce which i hate but kinda like in clams as one bespeaks poor hygiene and the other the sea i hate what were doing to the sea dragging huge chains across the bottom bleaching reefs

sweet i scarce can call it mine but when to me alone your secret tears you show oh then i feel those tears my own and claim them while they flow then still with bright looks bless the gay the cold the free give smiles to those who love you less but keep your tears for me the snow on juras steep can smile in many a beam yet still in chains of coldness sleep how bright soeer it seem but when some deep felt ray whose touch is fire appears oh then the smile is warmd away and melting turns to tears then still with bright looks bless the gay the cold the free give smiles to those who love you less but keep your tears for me in these deep solitudes and awful cells where heavnly pensive contemplation dwells and ever musing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its long forgotten heat yet yet i love from abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name dear fatal name rest ever unreveald nor pass these lips in holy silence seald hide it my heart within that close disguise where mixd with gods his lovd idea lies o write it not my hand the name appears already written wash it out my tears in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays her heart still dictates and her hand obeys relentless walls whose darksome round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn ye grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thorn shrines where their vigils pale eyd virgins keep and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep though cold like you unmovd and silent grown i have not yet forgot myself to stone all is not heavns while abelard has part still rebel nature holds out half my heart nor prayrs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain soon as thy letters trembling i unclose that well known name awakens all my woes oh name for ever sad for ever dear still breathd in sighs still usherd with a tear i tremble too whereer my own i find some dire misfortune follows close behind line after line my gushing eyes oerflow led through a sad variety of woe now warm in love now withring in thy bloom lost in a convents solitary gloom there stern religion quenchd th unwilling flame there died the best of passions love and fame yet write oh write me all that i may join griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine nor foes nor fortune take this powr away and is my abelard less kind than they tears still are mine and those i need not spare love but demands what else were shed in prayr no happier task these faded eyes pursue to read and weep is all they now can do then share thy pain allow that sad relief ah more than share it give me all thy grief heavn first taught letters for some wretchs aid some banishd lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to its fires the virgins wish without her fears impart excuse the blush and pour out all the heart speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul and waft a sigh from indus to the pole thou knowst how guiltless first i met thy flame when love approachd me under friendships name my fancy formd thee of angelic kind some emanation of th all beauteous mind those smiling eyes attempring evry day shone sweetly lambent with celestial day guiltless i gazd heavn listend while you sung and truths divine came mended from that tongue from lips like those what precept faild to move too soon they taught me twas no sin to love back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran nor wishd an angel whom i lovd a man dim and remote the joys of saints i see nor envy them that heavn i lose for thee how oft when pressd to marriage have i said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame before true passion all those views remove fame wealth and honour what are you to love the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and bids them make mistaken mortals groan who seek in love for aught but love alone should at my feet the worlds great master fall himself his throne his world id scorn em all not caesars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love if there be yet another name more free more fond than mistress make me that to thee oh happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature law all then is full possessing and possessd no craving void left aching in the breast evn thought meets thought ere from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be and once the lot of abelard and me alas how changd what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had opposd the dire command barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain the crime was common common be the pain i can no more by shame by rage suppressd let tears and burning blushes speak the rest canst thou forget that sad that solemn day when victims at yon altars foot we lay canst thou forget what tears that moment fell when warm in youth i bade the world farewell as with cold lips i kissd the sacred veil the shrines all trembld and the lamps grew pale heavn scarce believd the conquest it surveyd and saints with wonder heard the vows i made yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixd but you not grace or zeal love only was my call and if i lose thy love i lose my all come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe those still at least are left thee to bestow still on that breast enamourd let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressd give all thou canst and let me dream the rest ah no instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care plants of thy hand and children of thy prayr from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you raisd these hallowd walls the desert smild and paradise was opend in the wild no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors no silver saints by dying misers givn here bribd the rage of ill requited heavn but such plain roofs as piety could raise and only vocal with the makers praise in these lone walls their days eternal bound these moss grown domes with spiry turrets crownd where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffusd a reconciling ray and gleams of glory brightend all the day but now no face divine contentment wears tis all blank sadness or continual tears see how the force of others prayrs i try o pious fraud of amrous charity but why should i on others prayrs depend come thou my father brother husband friend ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move and all those tender names in one thy love the darksome pines that oer yon rocks reclind wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wandring streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinkling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid but oer the twilight groves and dusky caves long sounding aisles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a death like silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades evry flowr and darkens evry green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods yet here for ever ever must i stay sad proof how well a lover can obey death only death can break the lasting chain and here evn then shall my cold dust remain here all its frailties all its flames resign and wait till tis no sin to mix with thine ah wretch believd the spouse of god in vain confessd within the slave of love and man assist me heavn but whence arose that prayr sprung it from piety or from despair evn here where frozen chastity retires love finds an altar for forbidden fires i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault i view my crime but kindle at the view repent old pleasures and solicit new now turnd to heavn i weep my past offence now think of thee and curse my innocence of all affliction taught a lover yet tis sure the hardest science to forget how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense and love th offender yet detest th offence how the dear object from the crime remove or how distinguish penitence from love unequal task a passion to resign for hearts so touchd so piercd so lost as mine ere such a soul regains its peaceful state how often must it love how often hate how often hope despair resent regret conceal disdain do all things but forget but let heavn seize it all at once tis fird not touchd but rapt not wakend but inspird oh come oh teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life myself and you fill my fond heart with god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayr accepted and each wish resignd labour and rest that equal periods keep obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composd affections ever evn tears that delight and sighs that waft to heavn grace shines around her with serenest beams and whispring angels prompt her golden dreams for her th unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymeneals sing to sounds of heavnly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy when at the close of each sad sorrowing day fancy restores what vengeance snatchd away then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee oh cursd dear horrors of all conscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight provoking daemons all restraint remove and stir within me every source of love i hear thee view thee gaze oer all thy charms and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms i wake no more i hear no more i view the phantom flies me as unkind as you i call aloud it hears not what i say i stretch my empty arms it glides away to dream once more i close my willing eyes ye soft illusions dear deceits arise alas no more methinks we wandring go through dreary wastes and weep each others woe where round some mouldring tower pale ivy creeps and low browd rocks hang nodding oer the deeps sudden you mount you beckon from the skies clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise i shriek start up the same sad prospect find and wake to all the griefs i left behind for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain thy life a long dead calm of fixd repose no pulse that riots and no blood that glows still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow or moving spirit bade the waters flow soft as the slumbers of a saint forgivn and mild as opening gleams of promisd heavn come abelard for what hast thou to dread the torch of venus burns not for the dead nature stands checkd religion disapproves evn thou art cold yet eloisa loves ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn to light the dead and warm th unfruitful urn what scenes appear whereer i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee thy image steals between my god and me thy voice i seem in evry hymn to hear with evry bead i drop too soft a tear when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priests tapers temples swim before my sight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drownd while altars blaze and angels tremble round while prostrate here in humble grief i lie kind virtuous drops just gathring in my eye while praying trembling in the dust i roll and dawning grace is opning on my soul come if thou darst all charming as thou art oppose thyself to heavn dispute my heart come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace those sorrows and those tears take back my fruitless penitence and prayrs snatch me just mounting from the blest abode assist the fiends and tear me from my god no fly me fly me far as pole from pole rise alps between us and whole oceans roll ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whateer was mine fair eyes and tempting looks which yet i view long lovd adord ideas all adieu oh grace serene oh virtue heavnly fair divine oblivion of low thoughted care fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky and faith our early immortality enter each mild each amicable guest receive and wrap me in eternal rest see in her cell sad eloisa spread proppd on some tomb a neighbour of the dead in each low wind methinks a spirit calls and more than echoes talk along the walls here as i watchd the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound come sister come it said or seemd to say thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and prayd loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep evn superstition loses evry fear for god not man absolves our frailties here i come i come prepare your roseate bowrs celestial palms and ever blooming flowrs thither where sinners may have rest i go where flames refind in breasts seraphic glow thou abelard the last sad office pay and smooth my passage to the realms of day see my lips tremble and my eye balls roll suck my last breath and catch my flying soul ah no in sacred vestments mayst thou stand the hallowd taper trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die ah then thy once lovd eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me see from my cheek the transient roses fly see the last sparkle languish in my eye till evry motion pulse and breath be oer and evn my abelard be lovd no more o death all eloquent you only prove what dust we dote on when tis man we love then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy that cause of all my guilt and all my joy in trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drownd bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round from opning skies may streaming glories shine and saints embrace thee with a love like mine may one kind grave unite each hapless name and graft my love immortal on thy fame then ages hence when all my woes are oer when this rebellious heart shall beat no more if ever chance two wandring lovers brings to paracletes white walls and silver springs oer the pale marble shall they join their heads and drink the falling tears each other sheds then sadly say with mutual pity movd oh may we never love as these have lovd from the full choir when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice amid that scene if some relenting eye glance on the stone where our cold relics lie devotions self shall steal a thought from heavn one human tear shall drop and be forgivn and sure if fate some future bard shall join in sad similitude of griefs to mine condemnd whole years in absence to deplore and image charms he must behold no more such if there be who loves so long so well let him our sad our tender story tell the well sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost he best can paint em who shall feel em most moon came to the forge in her petticoat of nard the boy looks and looks the boy looks at the moon in the turbulent air moon lifts up her arms showing pure and sexy her beaten tin breasts run moon run moon moon if the gypsies came white rings and white necklaces they would beat from your heart boy will you let me dance when the gypsies come theyll find you on the anvil with your little eyes shut run moon run moon moon i hear the horses hoofs leave me boy dont walk on my lane of white starch the horseman came beating the drum of the plains the boy at the forge has his little eyes shut through the olive groves in bronze and in dreams here the gypsies come their heads riding high their eyelids hanging low how the night heron sings how it sings in the tree moon crosses the sky with a boy by the hand at the forge the gypsies cry and then scream the wind watches watches the wind watches the moon translated from the spanish indeed i must confess when souls mix tis an happiness but not complete till bodies too do join and both our wholes into one whole combine but half of heaven the souls in glory taste till by love in heaven at last their bodies too are placed in thy immortal part man as well as i thou art but something tis that differs thee and me and we must one even in that difference be i thee both as a man and woman prize for a perfect love implies love in all capacities can that for true love pass when a fair woman courts her glass something unlike must in loves likeness be his wonder is one and variety for he whose soul nought but a soul can move does a new narcissus prove and his own image love that souls do beauty know tis to the bodys help they owe if when they knowt they straight abuse that trust and shut the body fromt tis as unjust as if i brought my dearest friend to see my mistress and at thinstant he should steal her quite from me the plane is packed and over sweaty heads rumpled hair the movie glows in the transatlantic nighttime murmur of priests and nuns and riverdancers returning home a baby is cooed by an older mother a boy feels for his seat in the dark ive read my books already days traveling the difficulties technical i hate that money says the priest beside me and he orders another scotch his third the feast of the epiphany tomorrow he studies religious journals for a message writes in a notebook impossibly small we are having problems with sound the flight attendant announces it is not your headset and so the oceans swell in silence bright blue tumbles across the screen mutely foam collapsing over a tiny nimble figure but she darts through to a green glow sunshine through a veil of wave her surfboard tense between her feet and the worlds largest ocean her ride is long impossibly long her hips stay low a friend drops onto her wave and together they glide towards the shore no music just water and that blue i check the skymall catalogue for something i might need and didnt know there are reasons i am flying over the ocean reasons i i wish i were sure of someday i might say yes i chose him and it wasnt wise or maybe well be old and surrounded by our own the screen flashes the surf is wild but the bright sky makes me whisper hawaii where nothing could be that beautiful but is the waves are bigger and she sets out flowered bikini hair pulled back in a serious bun but too soon shes underwater arms above her head spinning down into a champagne sea the priest asks would i like some english chocolate i say no at first then say yes i say how many euros for the scotch the baby jesus is about to be adored by black men foreign kings in fact tomorrow theyre stumbling the magi days across an ocean and through the desert its hot so they must travel at night who wouldnt and there was that star sudden and perhaps a sign weve already tried to get there once i want to say to the kings its cool in this which later the pilot will land with only one engine a problem with compressors but what a sweet sweet ocean and those few younger girls who try to ride it and what a night warmed by the sun shocked smell of saddle and sweat the strong breath of camels what carved fragrant trunkfuls born across deserts and ready to be opened before an infant god its often those who talk a streak on world affairs and love and peace who seem to love and peace the least i eventually we must combine nightmares an angel smoking a cigarette on the steps of the last national bank said to me i put her out with my thumb i dont need that cheap talk ive got my own problems it was sad exciting and horrible it was exciting horrible and sad it was horrible sad and exciting it was inviting mad and deplorable it was adorable glad and enticing eventually we must smoke a thumb cheap talk ive got my own angel on the steps of the problems the bank said to me i dont need that i will take this one window with its sooty maps and scratches so that my dreams will remember one another and so that my eyes will not become blinded by the new world ii the flames dont dance or slither they have painted the room green beautiful and naked the wives are sleeping before the fire now it is out the men have returned to the shacks slaved creatures from the forest floor across their white stationwagons that just about does it says the other dumping her bucket over her head well i guess we got everything says one feeling around in the mud as if for a child now they remember they want that mud who cant remember what they got up for they parcel it out when they are drunk enough they go into town with a bucket of mud sayingwe can slice it up into windmills like a bloated cow later they paint the insides of the shack black and sit sucking eggs all night they want something real useful but there isnt anything iii i will engineer the sunrise they have disassembled our shadows our echoes are erased from the walls your nipples are the skeletons of olives your nipples are an oriental delight your nipples blow away like cigarette papers your nipples are the mouths of mutes so i am not here any longer skein of lightning memorys dark ink in your last smile where the stars have swallowed their train schedule where the stars have drowned in their dark petticoats like a sock of hamburger receiving the lightning into his clitoris red on red the prisoner confesses his waltz through the corkscrew lightning nevermind the lightning in your teeth lets waltz i am the hashish pinball machine that rapes a piano boat me around gently whoever im with im seeing only you diplomacy has wounded us pierced us smashed us is there something in the turning of this rivers head that will mend our dislocations your eagle drives my ego there is ice in your thighs take the buoys of light for your thighpaths whose eyes night has darkened what is this tint that in the shrill cress will never cease to trouble us and in the fields gives prick and praise for beauty and said birds that feed on berries are pervious and shook the snow from his thighs i thought of nothing carefully but of snow and the birds then kissed the cup and sipped a little though almost choked drank slowly tickled with strange measure she faked a pretty anger i entertained the night with fantastic empty pleasure we went as far as the ivie bush and ivie crowns upon our heads and carried her kiss untouched and entire then all was fresh inclined to wriggle and nussle and lascivious ardent leaps in the thickest of the wood bid him kiss close and often and directed him to her fancie the ground had a sweeter scent the boughs a blush one fruit rare and rich would outdo many together she was wild to climb the tree nor would she be forbidden she seized the apple and put it in her bosom fair lovely maid or if that title be too weak too feminine for nobler thee permit a name that more approaches truth and let me call thee lovely charming youth this last will justifie my soft complainte while that may serve to lessen my constraint and without blushes i the youth persue when so much beauteous woman is in view against thy charms we struggle but in vain with thy deluding form thou givst us pain while the bright nymph betrays us to the swain in pity to our sex sure thou wert sent that we might love and yet be innocent for sure no crime with thee we can commit or if we shoud thy form excuses it for who that gathers fairest flowers believes a snake lies hid beneath the fragrant leaves thou beauteous wonder of a different kind soft cloris with the dear alexis joind when eer the manly part of thee woud plead thou tempts us with the image of the maid while we the noblest passions do extend the love to hermes aphrodite the friend though half my years besiege the aged sun i have not lived my robust preparation lags tardily behind fit consummation droops sweatily in courses just begun oh i have loved and lusted with the best plucked momentary music from the senses ive kissed a lip or two with fair pretensesand wept for softness of a womans breast my mind rebounds to nether joys and pain toying with filth and pharisaic leaven i know the lift up sundry peaks to heaven and every rockless path to hell again i wait the hour when gods have more to givethan husks and bare insatiate will to live take oh take those lips away that so sweetly were forsworn and those eyes the breake of day lights that do mislead the morn but my kisses bring again bring again seals of love but sealed in vain sealed in vain this morning as i gulp five gleaming white capsules of shark cartilage to make me strong again i want another look at the terrible eye with its nictitating membrane those extravagant fins the ampullae of lorenzini freckling its snout all of that huge body on the rippled sand in turtle grass with an entourage of neon blue barjacks and a remora wriggling in and out of its gill slits i even want to touch it again and this time not just with my fingertips but my palm loveline and lifeline my wrist the underside of my forearm i want to press my cheek against its chaste astonishing skin smooth as a headstone want the touch that feels like a blow the summoning touch the touch of reckoning the consummating touch as well as the stinging sandblown touch of regret the strangers touch on the train the reproachful touch even the last touch of a human who has lain down with a shark the touch i have spent my life so ignorant of your touch as you unbutton my shirt the searing unbearable touch the curve of her hip where id lay my head thats what im thinking of now her fingers gone slow through my hair on a blue day ten thousand miles off in the future somewhere where the beer is so cold it sweats in your hand cool as her kissing you with crushed ice her tongue wet with blackberry and melon thats what im thinking of now because im all out of adrenaline all out of smoking incendiaries somewhere deep in the landscape of the brain under the skulls blue curving dome thats where i am now swaying in a hammock by the waters edge as soldiers laugh and play volleyball just down the beach while others tan and talk with the nurses who bring pills to help them sleep and if this is crazy then let this be my sanatorium let the doctors walk among us here marking their charts as they will i have a lover with hair that falls like autumn leaves on my skin water that rolls in smooth and cool as anesthesia birds that carry all my bullets into the barrel of the sun snow hurries the strawberries from the bush star wet water rides you into summer into my autumn your cactus hands are at my heart again lady i court my dream of you in lilies and in rain i vest myself in your oldest memory and in my oldest need and in my passion you are the deepest blue of the oldest rose star circle me an axe i cannot cut myself from any of your emblems it will soon be cold here and dark here the grass will lie flat to search for its spring head i will bow again in the winter of your eyes if there is music it will be the weathers bells to call me to the abandoned chapel of your simple body discipline free will doesnt mean freewheel but what about eros let eros harrow whom he will

she sat in time you thief who love to get sweets into your list put that in say im weary say im sad say that health and wealth have missed me say im growing old but add jenny kissed me if i leave all for thee wilt thou exchange and be all to me shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this nay wilt thou fill that place by me which is filled by dead eyes too tender to know change thats hardest if to conquer love has tried to conquer grief tries more as all things prove for grief indeed is love and grief beside alas i have grieved so i am hard to love yet love me wilt thou open thine heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove

out of love did lady day prez ever hold each other plead to those notorious gods i dont know but i do know even if a horn voice plumb the unknown what remains unsaid coalesces around an old blues begs

would forget her rings in our handstwo boys who used to dance for her spilling water from my back you call and i come that exhausted walk to reach you breathless and no i didnt run to see you ive been smoking too much same thing another awkward hug in the car as my face smashes your cheek that i can feel it leaving now is the saddest a beautiful eruption you could have picked it off the tree and chowed but you werent hungry feeling it dying away all day much worse than the straining against the leash another gorgeous thing that should not have happened gone again about whats past hold on when you can i used to say and when you cant let go as if memory were one of those mechanical bulls easily dismountable should the ride turn rough i lived in those days at the forests edge metaphorically so it can sometimes seem now though the forest was real as my life beside it was i spent much of my time listening to the sounds of random un knowable things dropping or being dropped from variously a middling height or a great one until by winter it was just the snow falling each time like a new unnecessary taxonomy or syntax for how to parse whats plain snow from which the occasional lost hunter would emerge every few or so seasons and just once a runaway child whom i gave some money to and told no one about having promised you must keep what youve promised very close to your heart that way youll never forget is what ive always been told ive been told quite a lot of things they hover some more unbidden than others in that part of the mind where mistakes and torn wishes echo as in a room thats been newly cathedraled so that the echo surprises though lately its less the echo itself that can still most surprise me about memory its more the time it takes going away a mouth opening to say i love sex with you too it doesnt mean i wanna stop my life for it for example or just a voice mouthless asking since when does the indifference of the bodys stance when were alone unwatched in late light amount to cruelty for the metaphysical poets the problem with weeping for whats been lost is that tears wash out memory and by extension what wed hoped to remember if i refuse increasingly to explain isnt explanation at the end of the day what the sturdier truths most resist its been my experience that tears are useless against all the rest of it that if i could id forget that i keep wanting to stay should count at least for something im not done with you yet if you sleep the night inside someone her cells saltwater stained fuse with yours like the blood of twins apes in

breeze in its listlessness travelling across the wet mead to me here you being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness heard no more again far or near thus i faltering forward leaves around me falling wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward and the woman calling there is this tea i have sometimes pan long ying hao so tightly curled it looks like tiny roots gnarled a greenish gray when it steeps it opens the way you woke this morning stretching your hands behind your head back arched toes pointing a smile steeped in ceremony a celebration the reaching of your arms everyone at lake kearney had a nickname there was a bumstead a tonto a tex and from the slogan of a popular orchestra two sisters swing and sway swing jitterbugged hopping around on the dance floor working up a sweat sway was beautiful my heart went out to her when she lifted her heavy rack of dishes and passed through the swinging door she was engaged to an enlisted man who was stationed at fort dix he came once or twice on weekends to see her i tried talking to him but he didnt answer out of stupidity or dislike i could not tell which in real life he was a furniture salesman this was the hero on whom she had chosen to bestow her affections i told her of my ambition to write novels conveying the excitement of life the main building lit up like a liner on saturday night the sound of the band clarinet saxophone snare drum piano he who would know your heart america must seek it in your songs and the contents of your purse among kleenex aspirin chewing gum wrappers combs et cetera dont stop she said im listening here it is flourishing her lighter in the afternoon when the dishes were washed and tables wiped we rowed out on the lake i read aloud the duino elegies while she reclined one shapely knee up trailing a hand in the water she had chestnut colored hair her eyes were changing like the surface with ripples and the shadows of clouds beauty i read to her is nothing but beginning of terror were still just able to bear she came from jersey the industrial wasteland behind which manhattan suddenly rises i could visualize the street where she lived and see her muffled against the cold in galoshes trudging to school running about in tennis shoes all through the summer i could hear the porch swing squeak and see into the parlor it was divided by a curtain or screen thats it she said all but the screen there isnt any when she or her sister had a boyfriend their mother used to stay in the parlor pretending to sew and keeping an eye on them like fate at night she would lie awake looking at the sky spangled over her thoughts were as deep and wide as the sky as time went by she had a feeling of missing out that everything was happening somewhere else some of the kids she grew up with went crazy like a car turning over and over one of her friends had been beaten by the police some vital fluid seemed to have gone out of him his arms and legs shook busted springs she said when youre a famous novelist will you write about me i promised and tried to keep my promise recently looking for a toolbox i came upon some typewritten pages all about her there she is in a canoe a gust of wind rustling the leaves along the shore playing tennis running up and down the baseline down by the boathouse listening to the orchestra playing sleepy lagoon then the trouble begins i can never think of anything to make the characters do we are still sitting in the moonlight while she finishes her cigarette two people go by talking in low voices a car door slams driving off i suppose we ought to go i say and she says not yet why speak of hate when i do bleed for love not hate my love but love doth bite my tongue till i taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough so flatter i my fever for the one for whom i inly mourn though seem to shun a rose is arrows is eros so what if i confuse the shade that ive become with winedark substance in a lovers cup but stop my tonguely wound ive bled enough if i be fair or false or freaked with fear if i my tongue in lock d box immure blame not me for i am sick with love yet would i be your friend most willingly since friendship would infect me killingly a boy from brooklyn used to cruise on summer nights as soon as hed hit sixty hed hold his hand out the window cupping it around the wind hed been assured this is exactly how a womans breast feels when you put your hand around it and apply a little pressure now he knew and he loved it night after night again and again until the weather grew cold and he had to roll the window up for many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting to soar one winters night holding his wifes breast in his hand he closed his eyes and wanted to weep he loved her but it was the wind he imagined now as he grew older he loved the word etcetera and refused to abbreviate it he loved sweet white butter he often pretended to be playing the organ on one of his last mornings he noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow he shook it out but the next morning it reappeared sometimes it takes miles to give up resistance though the mirror shows a body unresisting shows perhaps something to admire others may a body without difficulty loosening breaking its own willfulness cracking itself like a rusted bolt that finally begins to turn a body that turns toward openness fantasy those desires of and not of the body sometimes i notice a powerful man engaged steadily repeating difficult action folding himself his tight skin over and over lifting a declined torso or pulling up a suspended trunk and think how neat how controlled to be inside that body i struggle not to stare grip myself not to lose myself inside the thought of being inside that body i can never get there i know because it is the image i want the veneer of muscle having taken primacy from mind now first among equals bicep abdominal quadricep the launch after launch of a perpetual run i want the image even when i am it or nearly it because even then i am also that other thing self conscious burdened struggling for movement if there is a link between god and animals the way he identifies with the so much that isnt us as he had to have to have made them it must be in the body enacting will immediate through movement as if with a word creating a world enacting creation immediate through speech which is to say this is my time of prayer my only time miles in as long as it takes for the body to relinquish resistance bright public surrounded by others who move toward better movement and all the while seeing in a wall of mirrors that image of myself deer horse running close kin to breathing motion necessary to survival perfect image of a man that im merely a self conscious copy of i pray for things of course for myself and for those whose pain touches me selfish and unselfish prayers for intimates and strangers i pray for the runner in the mirror too sleek easy animal unselfconscious and present and absent as a god the man who could almost be me who i do my best to rush toward i pray that one day by his grace we may meet the world is full of loss bring wind my love my home is where we make our meeting place and love whatever i shall touch and read within that face lift wind my exile from my eyes peace to look life to listen and confess freedom to find to find to find that nakedness i woke you were lying beside me in the double bed prone your long dark hair fanned out over the downy pillow id been dreaming we stood on a beach an ocean away watching the waves purl into their troughs and tumble over knit one purl two you said something in your voice made me think of women knitting by the guillotine your eyes met mine the fetch of a wave is the distance it travels you said from where it is born at sea to where it founders to shore i must go back to where it all began you waded in thigh deep waist deep breast deep head deep until you disappeared i lay there and thought how glad i was to find you again you stirred in the bed and moaned something i heard a footfall on the landing the rasp of a mans cough he put his head around the door he had my face i woke you were not there in that proud port which her so goodly graceth whiles her faire face she reares up to the skie and to the ground her eie lids low embaseth most goodly temperature ye may descry myld humblesse mixt with awfull majesty for looking on the earth whence she was borne her minde remembreth her mortalitie what so is fayrest shall to earth returne but that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne base thing and thinke how she to heaven may clime treading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne that hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime yet lowly still vouchsafe to looke on me such lowlinesse shall make you lofty be this holy season fit to fast and pray men to devotion ought to be inclind therefore i likewise on so holy day for my sweet saint some service fit will find her temple fair is built within my mind in which her glorious image placed is on which my thoughts do day and night attend like sacred priests that never think amiss there i to her as th author of my bliss will build an altar to appease her ire and on the same my heart will sacrifice burning in flames of pure and chaste desire the which vouchsafe o goddess to accept amongst thy dearest relics to be kept glory be to god for sexy things for cries of coupled lovers as they bind and bow for moles that on her hipll make his dolphin swim fresh and fired up nutty balls g strings lovescapes pulsing and flesh shoaled furrow and plow and all shapes their

melodies to insentient stones earless trees and indifferent insects forsake them go winging to town like a dart to the mark i implore you and serving as courier bird tell her who is waiting this word im locked in my room and cant come but adore you you are my bread and the hairline noise of my bones you are almost the sea you are not stone or molten sound i think you have no hands this kind of bird flies backward and this love breaks on a windowpane where no light talks this is not time for crossing tongues the sand here never shifts i think tomorrow turned you with his toe and you will shine and shine unspent and underground dear letters fond letters must i with you part you are such a source of joy to my lonely heart sweet letters dear letters what a tell you tell o no power on earth can break this strange mystic spell dear letters fond letters you my secret know dont you tell it any one let it live and grow suddenly with a shy sad grace she turns to me her lighted face and i who hear some idle phrase watch how her wry lips move and guess that the poor words they frame mean naught for they would speak the same message i read in the dark flame within her eyes which say i love but i can only turn away i that have heard the deep voice break into a sing song sobbing shake whose flutter made my being quake what ears have i for womens cries i that have seen the turquoise glaze fixed in the blue and quivering gaze of one whom cocaine cannot daze how can i yield to womens eyes i who can only turn away i that have held strong hands which palter borne the full weight of limbs that falter bound live flesh on the surgeons altar what need have i of womens hand i that have felt the deads embrace i whose arms were his resting place i that have kissed a dead mans face ah but how should you understand now i can only turn away my sweetest lesbia let us live and love and though the sager sort our deeds reprove let us not weigh them heavens great lamps do dive into their west and straight again revive but soon as once set is our little light then must we sleep one ever during night if all would lead their lives in love like me then bloody swords and armor should not be no drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move unless alarm came from the camp of love but fools do live and waste their little light and seek with pain their ever during night when timely death my life and fortune ends let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends but let all lovers rich in triumph come and with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb and lesbia close up thou my little light and crown with love my ever during night in our arteries and eyes a hundred lightbulbs throb like drugs the furnace a permanent mishap and up in the dusk there is lucid debris a conduit a wire mask a swastika of corn boy and or girl small well find some horizon an intricate faking in which to lose way here we are not speaking or dead here we are or dead to what do we owe this forgetting not to kiss not that any given face is not afraid i the story of him who knew the most of all men know who made the journey heartbroken reconciled who knew the way things were before the flood the secret things the mystery who went to the end of the earth and over who returned and wrote the story on a tablet of stone he built uruk he built the keeping place of anu and ishtar the outer wall shines in the sun like brightest copper the inner wall is beyond the imagining of kings study the brickwork study the fortification climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace study how it is made from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields the ponds and orchards this is uruk the city of gilgamesh the wild ox son of lugalbanda son of the lady wildcow ninsun gilgamesh the vanguard and the rear guard of the army shadow of darkness over the enemy field the web the flood that rises to wash away the walls of alien cities gilgamesh the strongest one of all the perfect the terror it is he who opened passes through the mountains and he who dug deep wells on the mountainsides who measured the world and sought out utnapishtim beyond the world it is he who restored the shrines two thirds a god one third a man the king go to the temple of anu and ishtar open the copper chest with the iron locks the tablet of lapis lazuli tells the story ii there was no withstanding the aura or power of the wild ox gilgamesh neither the fathers son nor the wife of the noble neither the mothers daughter nor the warriors bride was safe the old men said is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people the gods of heaven listened to their complaint aruru is the maker of this king neither the fathers son nor the wife of the noble is safe in uruk neither the mothers daughter nor the warriors bride is safe the old men say is this the shepherd of the people is this the wise shepherd protector of the people there is no withstanding the desire of the wild ox they called the goddess aruru saying to her you made this man now create another create his double and let the two contend let stormy heart contend with stormy heart that peace may come to uruk once again aruru listened and heard and then created out of earth clay and divine spittle the double the stormy hearted other enkidu the hairy bodied wild man of the grasslands powerful as ninurta the god of war the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles visits the watering places with the creatures whose hearts delight as his delights in water iii one day a hunter came to a watering place and saw enkidu he stood expressionless astonished then with his silent dogs he went home to his fathers house fear in his belly his face was as one estranged from what he knows he opened his mouth and said to his father father i saw a hairy bodied man today at the watering place powerful as ninurta the god of war he feeds upon the grasslands with gazelles he visits the watering places with the beasts he has unset my traps and filled my hunting pits the creatures of the grasslands get away free the wild man sets them free because of him i am no longer a hunter his father said go to uruk and there present yourself to gilgamesh the king who is the strongest of all the perfect the terror the wise shepherd protector of the people tell him about the power of the wild man ask him to send a harlot back with you a temple prostitute to conquer him with her greater power when he visits the watering place let her show him her breasts her beauty for his wonder he will lie with her in pleasure and then the creatures the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them so the hunter went to gilgamesh in uruk and told him about the power of the wild man and how he had unset the traps and filled the pits so that the creatures got away free the lord of uruk said to the hunter then when you return a temple prostitute will go with you and with her beauty conquer the wild man he will lie with her and then the gazelles with whom he feeds upon the grasslands and the others with whom he visits the watering places will flee from him who ranged the hills with them iv the harlot and the hunter traveled together taking three days back to the watering place for three more days they waited and finally enkidu came with the creatures that love the water the gazelles and the others so as to drink their fill the temple prostitute looked at him enkidu the hairy bodied wild man of the grasslands the hair of his head like the grain fields of the goddess naked as sumuqan the god of cattle that is enkidu shamhat show him your breasts show him your beauty spread out your cloak on the ground lie down on it the wild man will look at you show him your body the hairy bodied man will come to you and lie down on you and then show him the things a woman knows how to do the gazelles and with them all the other creatures will flee from him who ranged the hills with them and so the harlot shamhat showed him her breasts showed him her body the hairy bodied man came over to her and lay down on her and then she showed him the things a woman knows how to do for seven days enkidu in his wonder lay with her in pleasure and then at last went to seek out the company of the creatures whose hearts delight in feeding upon the grasslands and visiting the watering places and ranging the hills but seeing him they fled the creatures were gone and everything was changed his body that loved to range the hills was now unable to follow but in the mind of the wild man there was beginning a new understanding bewildered he turned and sought out the company of the temple prostitute he sat down beside her and looked into her face and listened to her enkidu now you are beautiful as a god why do you seek the company of beasts come with me to the city to uruk to the temple of anu and the goddess ishtar gilgamesh is the ruler the strongest of all the terror the aura and power of his desire can be withstood by no one then enkidu whose heart was beginning to know about itself and longed for a companion cried aloud take me to uruk the city of gilgamesh whose aura and power cannot be withstood i will cry out in uruk challenging him it is i enkidu the strength of the wild man born in the wilderness cannot be withstood the temple prostitute replied come then to uruk where the processions are and music and let us go together through the dancing to the palace hall where gilgamesh presides the favorite of the gods the beautiful strongest of all the terror the most desired look at his radiant face the favorite of shamash and enlil ea and anu while you were grazing beastlike with gazelles before your mind had any understanding his mind a gift to the gifted of the gods had a dream of you before you knew of him in the early morning gilgamesh arose and told his mother his dream i had a dream a star fell from the heavens a meteorite and lay on the empty plain outside uruk the men and women came and wondered at it i strove with it to lift it but could not i was drawn to it as if it was a woman all knowing rimat ninsun spoke to him the lord of uruk gilgamesh his mother all knowing rimat ninsun spoke and said the star that fell from the heavens the meteorite that lay on the empty plain outside uruk the star you could not lift when you strove with it the star you were drawn to as if drawn to a woman is the strong companion powerful as a star the meteorite of the heavens a gift of the gods that you were drawn to it as if drawn to a woman means that this companion will not forsake you he will protect and guard you with his life this is the fortunate meaning of your dream then gilgamesh the lord of uruk said may the dream as you interpret come to pass the temple prostitute thus told the tale come my lucasia since we see that miracles mens faith do move by wonder and by prodigy to the dull angry world lets prove theres a religion in our love for though we were designd t agree that fate no liberty destroyes but our election is as free as angels who with greedy choice are yet determind to their joyes our hearts are doubled by the loss here mixture is addition grown we both diffuse and both ingross and we whose minds are so much one never yet ever are alone we court our own captivity than thrones more great and innocent twere banishment to be set free since we wear fetters whose intent not bondage is but ornament divided joyes are tedious found and griefs united easier grow we are our selves but by rebound and all our titles shuffled so both princes and both subjects too our hearts are mutual victims laid while they such power in friendship lies are altars priests and offrings made and each heart which thus kindly dies grows deathless by the sacrifice its september ive moved into town into the attic of an old barn a big open room i reach by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor the room is long and high with windows at each end a row of skylights that leak rain and shake and chatter in the northeast winds i sleep beneath the roofs steep pitch my mattress flat on the boards looking up at the high ceiling where morning diffuses downward in grains of bright dust this was the old painters studio the light in those famous canvases is still here he couldnt carry it away with him though his paintings took away everything else opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow i think of his violent loves the stories they still tell about him here but how quiet and alive his paintings were how they quiver with the life not yet realized the town is quiet in september sometimes i hear people talking in the street last night someone said they were going to wait for michael and a voice said that michael had gone home i walk the narrow path down to the marsh wind hard in the dunes rain as im returning cutting through twisting streets past gardens bent low with rain their colors a wash of gold i feel the air surround my body feel it move between my legs and between each finger as i walk not mastering space but in it and when the clouds open the sky suddenly wide and high no roof of leaves it seems theres nowhere to go but into wind or water i climb the narrow stairs that keep turning twisting inward until they meet the ceiling which opens and i rise through the floor released into an openness i never learn to expect at the yellow table i sit and read an interview with picassos lover francoise gilot the only one to leave him and have another life she says she was not destroyed by him as the others were because i am of the stuff that cannot be destroyed i felt something blow through me then some devouring wind surely then i am of the stuff that can be destroyed havent i felt it the breaking of all i was dont i sit and count my losses here in this room where all the life i knew has ended so bare with desire i seem to be eating sky thats how it is here im lonely sad the wind blows along the roof and i cant sleep rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor leaving dirty puddles on the boards a yellow table and a cupboard painted blue three chairs that dont match or even balance rightly a dented bucket its metal reflecting darkly what is what cannot be taken away whats beautiful here the whole thing is beauty a clarity not in things but around them complete and still i seem to remain somehow

york city is a scale model in my penthouse in north carolina where i study economics capital markets and the world bank i like to look into a scene from the top of a building in my hometown down at the traders who are moving here from new york city because new york city started to be kind of like a losing place for wealth creation now i look down on them and say to myself im too big to fail i take my keys off of the ledge and walk down the condominium tower overlooking the entire city when i reach the parking deck i open the door of a mercedes benz sl and coast to a place called high street im at high street knocking back a gin and tonic with three girls i met at the arts technology center conference on the decline of the book we have a laugh about the old guard who make a book bound in glue and then pinch angel dust off our palms at this point im so high im like look why dont we excuse ourselves and go up to my condominium tower ive just invested million dollars in they are like uh we can do that so we pile into my sl and ride to the tower listening to the music of frankie valli transform our night into a piece of artwork nearly there i look around at the arts technology girls and sort of hum to myself i feel like ive hit a milestone in my evening when we trip into the foyer of my massive penthouse that has those gleaming glass cubes set into the wall you see in miami or miami beach from the cubes a glimmer of the prosperity circling this region pierces the dark in the form of an orange yellow beam of fluorescent light one of the girls is removing her jewelry and im like no dont she takes off her clothes instead and lies face down on the carpet at the stereo i play a song by frankie valli the other two are kind of standing around surprised i think by the curtain of paperback books lining the north wall those are only bound books i tell them while i finger the kindle on my coffee table it is the new large kindle and we are looking at a book called boredom by alberto moravia taking turns reading passages from the screen when we get to the part when the boho girl is fucking the protagonist the totally white breast of one of the arts technology girls slips coolly from her blouse pretending not to notice i continue to read in my turn the girl sitting on the other side of me is wearing some totally white string of pearls and shes removing everything but the pearls i continue to read the screen while the arts technology girls start to make out like i had been planning for them to do ever since we licked angel dust off each others palms i get up and go to the stereo set the needle back to the gold record cant take my eyes off you and walk calmly to the sofa once im there i melt into the sand rubbed upholstery with the arts technology girls who havent yet passed out on the floor while im lying with my back to the armrest i glimpse a piece of sky ive seen only in films of the old grain its a wild purple darkness with a bright white hole in it im thinking to myself god my personal jesus christ and saviour i want you to come down here through that hole in the night and join me in eden away above a harborful of caulkless houses among the charley noble chimneypots of a rooftop rigged with clotheslines a woman pastes up sails upon the wind hanging out her morning sheets with wooden pins o lovely mammal her nearly naked breasts throw taut shadows when she stretches up to hang at last the last of her so white washed sins but it is wetly amorous and winds itself about her clinging to her skin so caught with arms upraised she tosses back her head in voiceless laughter and in choiceless gesture then shakes out gold hair while in the reachless seascape spaces between the blown white shrouds stand out the bright steamers to kingdom come they are a gift i have wanted again wanted one moment in mountains when winter got so cold the oil froze before it could burn i chopped ferns of hoarfrost from all the windows and peered up at pines a wedding cake by a baker gone mad swirls by the thousand shimmered above me until a cloud lumbered over a ridge bringing the heavier white of more flurries i believed i believed i believed it would last that when you went out to test the black ice or to dig out a volkswagon filled with rich women youd return and wed sputter like oil match after match warm in the making wisconsins flat farmland never approved i hid in cornfields far into october listening to music that whirled from my thumbprint when sunset played havoc with bright leaves of alders i never mentioned longing or fear i crouched like a good refugee in brown creeks and forgot why autumn is harder than spring but snug on the western slope of that mountain id accept every terror break open seals to release loves headwaters to unhurried sunlight werent we big hearts through some trick of silver we held one another believing each motion the real one ah lover why were dark sources bundled up in our eyes each owned an agate marbled with anguish a heart or its echo we hardly knew lips touching lips did that break my horizon as much as those horses broke my belief you drove off and i walked the old road scolding the doubles that wanted so much the chestnut mare whinnied a cloud into scrub pine in a windless corner of a corral four horses fit like puzzle pieces their dark eyes and lashes defined by the white the colt kicked his hind loped from the fence the mares and a stallion galloped behind lifting and leaping finding each other in full accord with the earth and their bodies no harm ever touched them once they cut loose snorting at flurries falling again how little our chances for feeling ourselves they vanished so quickly one flick of a tail where do their mountains and moments begin

gradeschool flowers that sort of stuff the loss of innocence he keeps talking about between poems which i can relate to especially under these circumstances now hes on to science a poem about hydrogen i think hes trying to imagine himself turning into hydrogen maybe hell succeed im imagining myself sliding up his wifes fluid rhythmic lusciously curved black stockinged legs imagining them arched

reason to erase the careful lives we have so far lived through there is no call for us to undermine the walls weve built no need to think anew of all the chains and choices that define us still and yet for all our fine intent a single touch ignites the night and tries resolve past all resisting what we meant before we mean again fidelities have yet been known to shift and come undone and all good reasons fail us one by one i blood we wondered if the rumors got to her id seen her with that other girl behind the stop and shop when i was walking home from school one day i swear the two of them were kissing plain as that the grass so high it brushed their cheeks i told my teacher so and maybe it was her who called their folks before too long it was like everyone in town had heard we waited for them at the dime store once where cedric grabbed her tits and said ill learn you how to love how god intended it you ugly fucking dyke thing was she wasnt ugly like youd think she had a certain quality a shyness maybe and id describe the way she laughed as kind of gentle anyway we never saw her with that girl again they say she got depressed shit at the service all of us got tearful i got to thinking what an awful sight it was all that red blood it wasnt in the papers but i heard melissas mother who was the nurse in the emergency that night say how she was just covered up in blood i cant think how you bring yourself to cut your throat like that yourself i asked the counselor they called in to the school and she said something like what better inkto write the language of the heart i guess it proves that stuff from bible school they say that such a life of sin breeds misery ii phlegm my brain is draining from my head he said as once again he blew his nose the clock read a m its second hand swept slowly through another viscous minute dead to even nurses sticking them for new ivs the other ones slept off their benders soundlessly im losing my intelligence he said and blew my patience waned he thought he was the president dementia ks hiv were printed in his problem list and plus im getting feverish i cant recall his name but i remember hating him grim wish that he would hurry up and die just then he took my hand and kissed the back of it as though i were a princess in his foreign land my lady you are beautiful he said and coughed again unsure of what to say my own throat burned he said you cant know what i feel iii bile a gun went off and killed a little girl the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer i walked through central park a black dog snarled at squirrels chattering like they had answers the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer i dreamed of killing someone with a knife the squirrels chattering had likely answers to all my angry questions about life a homeboy threatened someone with a knife not far from where a cop showed off his gun an angry answer to most questions about life i watched the squirrels hop the yuppies run the cop approached the black kids with his gun i wondered how much longer she would live the squirrels scattered when the homeboy ran i wondered if shed ever been in love i wondered who would pray for her to live forgive her for her anger and her weaknesses i wondered why it hurt to fall in love the cop tried aiming past me towards the woods forgive us for our anger for our weaknesses through central park past the black dogs snarls the cop gave chase a skirmish in the woods the gun went off no shrieked a little girl iv melancholy we picked at it with sticks at first until an older kid named samuel arrived he dropped a heavy rock right on its skull we watched as thick black slime began to ooze from somewhere just below its heart or where we thought its heart should be raccoon said someone solemnly the landscaper sweat gleaming like the polished figurines my mother wouldnt ever let me touch regarded us with keen suspicion from across the street we learned what it could teach like any bodys secrets the sublime receded toward the fact of death i knew both sadness and disgust in loves untruths youll find labels describing what is gone an empresss bones a stolen painting of a man in a feathered helmet holding a flag draped spear a vellum gospel hidden somewhere long ago forgotten would have sat on that pedestal this glass cabinet could have kept the first salts carried back from the levant to help us comprehend the magnitude of absence huge rooms lie empty of their wonders the colossus babylons hanging gardens and in this gallery empty shelves enough to hold all the scrolls of alexandria my love ive petitioned the curator who has acquired an empty chest representing all the poems you will now never write it will be kept with others in the poets gallery next door a vacant room echoes with the spill of jewels buried by a pirate who died before disclosing their whereabouts i hope you dont mind but i have kept a few of your pieces for my private collection i think you know the ones i mean o donald ye are just the man who when hes got a wife begins to fratch nae notice taen theyre strangers a their life the fan may drop she takes it up the husband keeps his chair she hands the kettle gives his cup without een thank ye dear now truly these slights are but toys but frae neglects like these the wife may soon a slattern grow and strive nae mair to please for wooers ay do all they can to trifle wi the mind they hold the blaze of beauty up and keep the poor things blind but wedlock tears away the veil the goddess is nae mair he thinks his wife a silly thing she thinks her man a bear let then the lover be the friend the loving friend for life think but thysel the happiest spouse shell be the happiest wife smoothed by sleep and ruffled by your dreams the surface of the little lake fed by unconscious tributary streams unbroken by the breezes nightmares make like your face looks fathomless and seems bottomless till light or noises wake you move and murmur and almost awake i admire but do not wish to enter like any wanderer beside moonlit water in midwinter who as a simulacrum for the tide casting a pebble into the calm centre watches the circles spread from side to side i wait for you and morning at your side such sources feed the mirror of your mind i dare not touch the surface of your sleep but to love by ignorance resigned infatuated guardian i keep watch beside a fountain where i find no image for images too deep above your breathing regular and deep lean and sane in the last hour of a long fast or fiercer discipline he could touch dust into a sudden surge of limbs and speak leaves in the night air above him inhabit quiet so wholly he heard roots inch into the unfeeling earth rings increasing inside of that tree without moving hardly breathing he could call out of the long darkness walls around him a house whose each room he knew its hoard of silences solitudes doors opening onto the wide fields through which he moved breathing deeply unbewildered by the dead with their hands of wind their faces of cloud stilled and gifted in the last hour before the first light in the dark place of his own making he could feel rocks relax alive beside him gather from a moon raveled river the pearl curves and blue fluency of a girl his hands once knew he could let her go he let it all go desire and grief and raw need going out of him moment by moment into the mild immaculate night love by love into a last passion of pure attention nerves readiness light carved out of the darkness a muscled trunk each clenched limb and the difficult tips of a plain mesquite taking shape over the hard ground where they found him his eyes wide and his whole body hungering upward as if he could hear and bear the bird singing unseen deep in those leaves it was in august such a lovely summer that i began the massacring the flower killing feeding the sunflowers to the industrial dough mixer soon there was enough yellow petal pulp for twelve loaves for twelve times ten loaves for twelve hundred loaves one of the food critics in town came around to inquire about my baking system i glanced at the machete propped next to the ovens toward october and what auburn weather i still feltit the substance of the soul the libidinal terrible whatever i sat out back with the two countergirls haley and shayla there was one cigarette and we were sharing mourning is the horizon of all desire we were commiserating but haley and shayla theyre they sell kaiser rolls and sliced sicilian and then they leave and put on a fancy tanktop and go out for the evening they go even though the little white clematis cling to the fences at dawn the buds were dying as a sweet white bread was rising november how beautiful were the yellow mums in the thin wintry sun the bread they made had the hue of golden potatoes december specks of red in lit windows amaryllis that i stole and slaughtered and sold inside a pain de mie roll i love how in the cold my breath flowers before me january february i hacked through the ice to get at flower fetuses the breads were very seedy spring it was really beginning baguettes made entirely of white peonies brioche from the blood of purple lilacs long lines outside the bakerys door what is the secret ingredient i confessed flower flowers please put me away i am desperate summer i could not go through another the woodbine had barely begun and already the mornings were full of the scent of them not one honeysuckle would go unsucked unless i closed the doors every season is too full of longing and rechristened myself flora i drank a vat of rose water and put both my wrists through the slicer and then i began to bleed a white powder flour and then you came in i would have known you even if you were not wearing in your buttonhole a carnation the bakery is closed i said tersely i was bleeding profusely i loved you even before you saidnothing breaks more slowly more silently than bread with my blood pouring out as a fine dry flour let me confess before i expire there on the counter in that vase fresh and pink is the corsage i was keeping for our dance it was your idea to park and watch the elephants swaying among the trees like royalty at that make believe safari near laguna i didnt know anything that big could be so quiet and once you stopped on a dark desert road to show me the stars climbing over each other riotouslylike insectslike an orchestra thrashing its way through time itself i never saw light that way again what do we need for love a midnight fire flinging itself by fistfuls up the chimney in soft bright snatches do we need the snow gentle as silence covering the scars of weeks of hunger years of shabby having summer or winter a heaven of stars a room the smiling mouth the sadness of desire are everywhere the same if lovers go along an unknown road they find no less what is familiar let them stay at home and all will still be strange this they know who with each heartbeat fight the fear of change scooby doo was trying to tell us something when every time that monster mask got snatched off it was a greedy white dude in a black comic gets on stage says you

soul would bargain for a cure that brings contempt the nobler agony to kill rather let me bear on the bitter ill and strike this rusty bosom with new stings it seems there is another veering fit since on a gold haired ladys eyeballs pure i looked with little prospect of a cure the while her mouths red bow loosed shafts of wit just heaven can it be true that jealousy has decked the woman thus and does her head swim somewhat for possessions forfeited madam you teach me many things that be i open an old book and there i find that women still may love whom they deceive such love i prize not madam by your leave the game you play at is not to my mind what a pity to die my love to say i dont love you anymore with no one listening what a shame the irritated voice the haste the distance between the first passionate whisper and this new timbre how little shame i have to have killed you and put you here beneath the very expanse you created the expanse is a cloth is white is a sheet is a land on which snow has fallen ssh youll be alone there no longer on top but under as is proper for the dead as is proper for seed and for lilies yet to sprout youll feel something like moving scratches those are birds mice my own bony hands that you adored my tongue with its thirst brr love how painful for me to see you shrunken by this chill so stripped of your gifts in this tomb where i cant grieve for you but can only dig down to the earth down to its iron to the fire that now embraces the earth and celebrates me i thought once how theocritus had sung of the sweet years the dear and wished for years who each one in a gracious hand appears to bear a gift for mortals old or young and as i mused it in his antique tongue i saw in gradual vision through my tears the sweet sad years the melancholy years those of my own life who by turns had flung a shadow across me straightway i was ware so weeping how a mystic shape did move behind me and drew me backward by the hair and a voice said in mastery while i strove guess now who holds thee death i said but there the silver answer rang not death but love the thing written is a sexual thing may bite tell a truth some have died for even the most casual initialing is a touch of love and what love goes for a sometime thing it smiles or has an ugly grin on the page or wall may be holy and a sin writing wants must have must know is flesh blood and bone proof we are not made to be alone beneath a dove and rainbow some bank their fire wrap their erogenous zones in barbed wire writing may dance in ink flamenco kneel before the cross right wrongs fall in love at first sight honor the naked languages it holds tight kidnap suck or be sucked for hire may look and look or sneak a look it has eyes can read is remarkable from the tower of sexual babble when dreams were the beginning of writing the angel of dreams descended stair by stair the stone watchtower became the first stone book writing never speaks word may ache to talk and yet each letter of any alphabet is a fragment of desire like half and quarter notes on a staff or a hawk may swoop down fly higher and higher to catch a word and then another word the sexual thing may be all love or malice eunuchs writing in the forbidden palace where poets dressed in rags or silk and lace the thing written touches kisses cuddles may be democratic autocratic medieval in

successless were as those before when damon lovely damon came our hearts strait felt a mutual flame i vowd id have him and no other without referring to my mother the jester walked in the garden the garden had fallen still he bade his soul rise upward and stand on her window sill it rose in a straight blue garment when owls began to call it had grown wise tongued by thinking of a quiet and light footfall but the young queen would not listen she rose in her pale night gown she drew in the heavy casement and pushed the latches down he bade his heart go to her when the owls called out no more in a red and quivering garment it sang to her through the door it had grown sweet tongued by dreaming of a flutter of flower like hair but she took up her fan from the table and waved it off on the air i have cap and bells he pondered i will send them to her and die and when the morning whitened he left them where she went by she laid them upon her bosom under a cloud of her hair and her red lips sang them a love song till stars grew out of the air she opened her door and her window and the heart and the soul came through to her right hand came the red one to her left hand came the blue they set up a noise like crickets a chattering wise and sweet and her hair was a folded flower and the quiet of love in her feet last night when the moon slipped into my attic room as an oblong of light i sensed shed come to commiserate it was august she traveled with a small valise of darkness and the first few stars returning to the northern sky and my room it seemed had missed her she pretended an interest in the bookcase while other objects stirred as in a rock pool with unexpected life strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed the paper crowded desk the books too appeared inclined to open and confess being sure the moon harbored some intention i waited watched for an age her cool gaze shift first toward a flower sketch pinned on the far wall then glide down to recline along the pinewood floor before id had enough moon i said were both scarred now are they quite beyond you the simple words of love say them you are not my mother with my mother i waited unto death whose hands touched first the headof the penis the shaft and was it soft or shale more rockthan clay and who pinched firstinto their place the small cups at the base of the ass who was itgot down there on whose knees and blew and was that passionor panic the machine that drovethose exhalations and howcould we rate the power of thatbreath breeze or gale or a whisperlike the song the little boy singsto the beetle whose small legs moved in tune like his legs the legs on that first body must havemoved if they did move when the dust settled in my mind everythings become enormous but was it ever small like that the first body did it ever sit close to the ants and their pilesof dirt from which that body had come you were a small boy once i suppose you were dirty from the start you showed me how to use a cock ring and why how without ever paying for a room to spend two weeks in any city how two men could fuck and continue to face each otherdirectly took my body and showed me my back on a table my knees by my head stretched me into seeing you were more than a dog you must be dead by now though i dont knowwhose hands prepared you whose fingersfingered for the final time all that dark and kinky hair if the first body was made of dirt in order to plumb the hollow of that first throat whose thumb first lodged inside the hingeof that first mouth to force it open to make the tongue so it could work who shoved inside that mouththe shit of a hundred thousand worms you couples lying where moon scythes and day scythes reaped you browning fruit falls and sleeps in tangled nests the wild grass falls from your apple tree that still grows here cry for your dead hero his weak sword his flight that you were slaughtered and your bed poured whiteness the issue of murdered marriage dawns the streets crack a house falls open to the air sun and rain lie on the bed and the river still runs in a childs hands under the factorys black hulk four stacks that used to bloom with smoke over shining leaves beneath thunderheads then the storm shatters and beats and after in woods a scented smoke of light a dripping quiet and the small gold snake sparkles at the ponds edge but who is he what were the goods he made what became of his loved wife his children and where has he gone fearsome powerless the silver path of air from the rivers bend to its rippling away beneath the low concrete bridge is still pure no one comes and the child who watched by it has vanished or sometimes he appears for a day a night in the walls and windows reflected on the water in goldfinches flight cricket song the herons great rise from the bank last a carp leaps voices and a lantern slide down the secret stream in black and gold peace past the childs husk the family never born i am not a poet sonya i inspectthe fragrant feet of younger ladies while deafness hums as a little motori watch her stand in the shower holding her breasts in her hands like two small explosions i am her boy drowning in this country he does not know the word for drowning and yells i am diving for the last time dear love where the red lillies blossomed and grew the white snows are falling and all through the wood where i wandered with you the loud winds are calling and the robin that piped to us tune upon tune neath the elm you remember over tree top and mountain has followed the june and left us december has left like a friend that is true in the sun and false in the shadows he has found new delights in the land where hes gone greener woodlands and meadows what care we let him go let the snow shroud the lea let it drift on the heather we can sing through it all i have you you have me and well laugh at the weather the old year may die and a new one be bornthat is bleaker and colder but it cannot dismay us we dare it we scorn for love makes us bolder ah robin sing loud on the far distant lea thou friend in fair weather but here is a song sung thats fuller of glee by two warm hearts together god with honour hang your head groom and grace you bride your bed with lissome scions sweet scions out of hallowed bodies bred each be others comfort kind d ep d eper than divined divine charity dear charity fast you ever fast bind then let the march tread our ears i to him turn with tears who to wedlock his wonder wedlock d als tr umph and immortal years i dont love you as if you were a rose of salt topaz or arrow of carnations that propagate fire i love you as one loves certain obscure things secretly between the shadow and the soul i love you as the plant that doesnt bloom but carries the light of those flowers hidden within itself and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose from the earth lives dimly in my body i love you without knowing how or when or from where i love you directly without problems or pride i love you like this because i dont know any other way to love except in this form in which i am not nor are you so close that your hand upon my chest is mine so close that your eyes close with my dreams come live with me and be my love and we will some new pleasures prove of golden sands and crystal brooks with silken lines and silver hooks there will the river whispering run warmd by thy eyes more than the sun and there the enamourd fish will stay begging themselves they may betray when thou wilt swim in that live bath each fish which every channel hath will amorously to thee swim gladder to catch thee than thou him if thou to be so seen best loth by sun or moon thou darknest both and if myself have leave to see i need not their light having thee let others freeze with angling reeds and cut their legs with shells and weeds or treacherously poor fish beset with strangling snare or windowy net let coarse bold hands from slimy nest the bedded fish in banks out wrest or curious traitors sleeve silk flies bewitch poor fishes wandring eyes for thee thou needst no such deceit for thou thyself art thine own bait that fish that is not catchd thereby alas is wiser far than i it wasnt holy so let us not praise gods let us not look to them for bread nor the cup that changed water to wine let us look to the bend of the road that reaches a silver blur across the skyline woman standing on the farm in her grasp the shine that is seed that is beginning she will work the earth bounty in the vault of cosmos above her heat lightning that lassoes in its manic current man never existed but to invite danger loveless one there was once an army of men saluting from bayonet to bomb they were expert at sabotage hand combat you stop the clock in your paltry chest the one that says choose choose wind that desired backward ring the alarm when you wake no more pain a mirror like a window looking out what can your past now say to you that has never been said before what of that clock that forbade you to move forward what of the clock that asked for nothing but passage the minutes careening into you like a fitful arrow what of the clock that summoned nothing not even mercy once you tired of wanting a face to break you started the clock again whereas the porch screen sags from the weight of flowers impatiens that grew against it then piles of wet leaves then drifted snow and whereas now rolled like absence in its drooping length a dim gold wave sundowns last cast across a sea of clouds and the floating year almost reaches the legs of the low slung chair and whereas between bent trees flies and bees twirl above apples and peaches fallen on blue gravel and whereas yesterdays thunder shook blossoms off laurel the day after they appeared and whereas in the dust the fine and perfect dust of cat paw prints scattered across the gleaming car hood something softer than blossoms falls away something your lips left on mine and whereas its anyones guess as to how long its been since a humid day sank so low so far from the present that missing sensations or the sensation of something missing have left impressions in the air the kind a head leaves on a pillow and whereas the last of ancient unconvincing notions evaporate from the damp pages of thick old books that describe how for instance time and love once lay together here how in a slurred flash of light she turned and waded back into the sea and how the slack part of any day was and is all in the way he half asleep felt her hand slip out of his and whereas the blue heron stands on the shore while the sleek heron turns broad to narrow half hidden among the reeds turning with the stealth the sweep of twilights narrowing minute of stillness taking aim turning until it almost disappears into the arrowhead instant the day disappears until staring out of the reeds the aforementioned heron is more felt than seen and whereas you with due forethought and deliberation bite into an apples heart and wish it were your own there are trees and they are on fire there are hummingbirds and they are on fire there are graves and they are on fire and the things coming out of the graves are on fire the house you grew up in is on fire there is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire there is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire there is a wooden cage were trapped in too large to see and it is on fire there are jaguars on fire wolves spiders wolf spiders on fire if there were people if our fathers were alive if we had a daughter fire to the edges fire in the river beds fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in fire in your mothers belly there is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb there is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse there is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair there is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur there are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us pooling around us forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud there is this feeling i get when i am with you there is our future house burning like a star on the hill there is our dark flickering shadow there is my hand on fire in your hand on fire my body on fire above your body on fire our tongues made of ash we are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet we have our whole life ahead of us the unsigned architecture of loneliness is becoming taller finding a way farther above the horizontal flowering of the cold war the peonies and star asters of wild partisanship i have a shambling gait and lonely hysteria but no terror i am free to shamble past the vacant lot of my sons conception to shamble past the bar where i conceived adultery as a terror that would be endless flowering in great waves through air striated like chenille i walk for a long time and try to conjure elsewhere in its early isolation i cannot it is all redestinated by the future like the loose balloons a janitor recovers at am from cold light fixtures the cold war is ending buildings are taller and have no names the romance of every ideology torments the romance of another how beautifully in the beginning in the gale and embrace of isolation boys capered over a shambles and swore oaths the scent of urine in the hall at home was righteousness the beautiful nude obscured by dust in a paperweight was righteousness neglectful townships coming into steep flower just as boys were flowering needed the correction of righteousness the horizontal slag of government by children only the insane allegiances endure the mad counterparts are lovers passion cannot explain nor circumstances restrict to the dead zones of irony a counterpart of end of the cold war is adultery a counterpart of loving a divided berlin unto death is fatherhood the doting maintenance of sons in vacant lots continuing the wars of rubble for righteousness sake and for the sake of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity romance torments romance the most beautiful moment of the twentieth century galed and embraced the acrid smoky air as the red army entered berlin as hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire as red army flags opened above berlin safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future townships blackened even as they flowered loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun i walked for a long time and tried to conjure the form of kindness it was a domestic animal confused in the tall grass boys set fire to the grass history that opens flags opened the fire and berlin divided from berlin began to love its children past all reason my son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls he starves the ground he walks on preparing a dead city to be worthy of its new flags to shine as exploded windows shine raining down for hours after the wrecking crews have gone i have a lover now who hates children the hatred floats inside of her a weightless sexual pavilion of perfect form and perfect emptiness i thought by making love to her i would conceive nothing but terror outrage upon outrage a violence that would last my whole life and free my son i was ignorant as a balloon across the luminous expressway i see the shapes of charred tenements castellated fading into the more tender shapes of night it may be the last night in history tomorrow pulls down the berlin wall pulls down my honor and i return to my lovers bed to float in a white condom no longer my sons father tomorrow describes everything in detail it explains nothing it does not teach my boy that tenements are better than the future better that peace more likely to produce brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings without end or walls denuded of their wire in the dead zone of irony before dawn only the cats cry like martyrs in the flame gates everywhere the brandenburg the great gate of kiev beneath which children stride onto an invisible crescendo disappearing into gasoline fires emerging as the new shapes of righteousness in slow vans through the brandenburg gate oaths are secret because none suspects that they are kept they thrust themselves towards us unashamedly like the insane homeless and we do not see them in our loneliness we see a chance for love in betrayal not death in our loneliness we see the happy triumph of glassy hands in free elections not the denuding of berlin or wanderings of children in vans reduced by fire to black transparencies in the morning shade when joan of arc surrendered to the flames she cried out jesus jesus some years later a failed magician who had lover her cried out joan joan as the flames mocked him with a sortilege too easy to be unreal or profitable i walk for a long time and try to conjure the form of loneliness without cold war it is ash upon ash a chiaroscuro aloft and on the ground completely still oaths are secret because none suspects the desperation of every object the child in every atom of the misused world thrust towards us crying out whatever sacred name it witnessed put to death on the ascending music of a wall our buildings are tall and have no names the parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers afterwards the calm is piteous but insubstantial as a smell of burn that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire imagine walking out of a house at sunrise and having to invent air invent light from nothing but untriggered memory all things beloved are recalled to pain air recollected from the wrists of girls braceleted for confirmation crossed light recollected from between the cars of night trains in a deep river valley where islands in the river glowed like swans air recollected form a ditch in flower light recollected from the sex of flowers in bare rooms the grainy light of blondes air recollected from religion light recollected form the incensed clutch of bodies before sunrise in the oaths of a great and ignorant lost cause imagine walking out of a house at sunrise having spent the night in bed with a stranger aloft and on the ground the calm unfurls like flags without device or slogan the inconsequence of the day ahead stirs airless atmospheres in darkness visible as daylight but without shade without cold war without the arbitrary demarcation of cause from cause of light and air from the unsexed improvisations of memory i cannot see to walk or breathe to breathe sex becomes applause sex becomes television and the bastard avant garde of lonely architecture breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city that marks the capital of nothing now a scratchy recorded call to prayer crosses the alley from one new building into mine the consolations of history are furtive then fugitive then forgotten like a bar of music that might have been obscene or sacred once in another city in the days before today my son is well he works the public ground and needs no antigone my lover sits beside him at dinner sharing a joke unmapping the tall future and its unbiased children reinventing the sexual pavilion to accommodate plague wards romance forgives romance the early isolation of this gorgeous century disappears into good works the future is best to put a final stop to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom and to the ruinous armies of mad boys whose government is rape whose justice is a wall revoke all partisanship adjourn the terror the future is best it unobscures the dusty nudes it protects the river islands and their glowing swans but when i need to die who will light the fire what names shall i cry out and what music burn to a black transparency in my heart the unborn have been revoked they will not be kind the weary yeare his race now having run the new begins his compast course anew with shew of morning mylde he hath begun betokening peace and plenty to ensew so let us which this chaunge of weather vew chaunge eeke our mynds and former lives amend the old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew and fly the faults with which we did offend then shall the new yeares joy forth freshly send into the glooming world his gladsome ray and all these stormes which now his beauty blend shall turne to caulmes and tymely cleare away so likewise love cheare you your heavy spright and chaunge old yeares annoy to new delight these ghost soldiers live underground with the vast oversupply of castoff lanterns if one were to take broadsword to one of these orange bearded mammoth men of rough hew he would laugh at the passing metal make light of entrails for years i have been here without a clear map that hopes should dim as days go on above is natural i suppose what do i know i am dressed like one of them the thick walls quake but stay soundproof i fear my fists vestigial these soldiers own panic is taking up rugs finding filigrees of the former world beneath e g a locket with their mongrels mush they will freeze then feign noncom smacking barrels of burgundy with pistol butts i react comme squirrel fleeing their reach to the chamber out of the impact area one loved me until i asked if he worried about what must be happening without us well his lips did narrow hand abandoned my knee blah blah big mouth were his departing words i will not say with shame that i came from nothing someone paved my first breakthrough at least one time calling it love and i will stand by that as it applies to my primary makeup it could of course be silk fifty yards or soof the next closest thing to water to the touch or it could just as easily be a shaft of wood crumpling a man struck between spaulder and helm but now with the rain making a noisy erasure of this town it is the flash that arrives and leaves at nearly the same moment its what i want to be in this moment in this doorway because much as id love to be the silk shimmer against the curve of anyones arm as brutal and impeccable as itd be to soar from a crossbow with a whistle and have a man switch off upon my arrival it is nothing compared to that moment when i eat the dark draw shadows in quick strokes across walland start a tongue counting down to thunder that counting that says i am this far i am this close this morning i felt my life if you were dead the expansiveness of the bed the birds still singing the remnants of the smell of coffee in the morning the emptiness of thought the deafening silence of my heart amyntas led me to a grove where all the trees did shade us the sun it self though it had strove it could not have betrayd us the place securd from humane eyes no other fear allows but when the winds that gently rise doe kiss the yielding boughs down there we satt upon the moss and id begin to play a thousand amorous tricks to pass the heat of all the day a many kisses he did give and i returnd the same which made me willing to receive that which i dare not name his charming eyes no aid requird to tell their softning tale on her that was already fird twas easy to prevaile he did but kiss and clasp me round whilst those his thoughts exprest and layd me gently on the ground ah who can guess the rest the pleasure of contrast not chained up in an oilcoth sack underwater holding his breath but composing himself for the camera in his only suit you have to understand photography unforgiving mirror unlike oils that soften the hard edges of a mans face if you want them to or velvet curtain shielding the pine box during an escape the audience imagines his bones contracting to a splinter thats not at all how its done the cameras lens blanketed by cloth to keep it in the dark any halo of light ruptures the film with shadow his eyes already turn inward to that place were going she thinks about escape too at the horse butcher in line like the others or arguing over the price of bread at the market of innocents adams rib is forever hidden inside her chest as the force of blows hibernates in a boxers fist but she at least is smiling when he says we have such a small family meaning your bodywont open to me its shackled inside its cage love and rage whose bars are meant to be broken from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april dressed in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in everything that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summers story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lilys white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet seemd it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play how sweetly said the trembling maid of her own gentle voice afraid so long had they in silence stood looking upon that tranquil flood how sweetly does the moon beam smile to night upon yon leafy isle oft in my fancys wanderings ive wishd that little isle had wings and we within its fairy bowrs were wafted off to seas unknown where not a pulse should beat but ours and we might live love die alone far from the cruel and the cold where the bright eyes of angels only should come around us to behold a paradise so pure and lonely would this be world enough for thee playful she turnd that he might see the passing smile her cheek put on but when she markd how mournfully his eyes met hers that smile was gone and bursting into heart felt tears yes yes she cried my hourly fears my dreams have boded all too right we part for ever part to night i knew i knew it could not last twas bright twas heavnly but tis past oh ever thus from childhoods hour ive seen my fondest hopes decay i never lovd a tree or flowr but twas the first to fade away i never nursd a dear gazelle to glad me with its soft black eye but when it came to know me well and love me it was sure to die now too the joy most like divine of all i ever dreamt or knew to see thee hear thee call thee mine oh misery must i lose that too yet go on perils brink we meet those frightful rocks that treachrous sea no never come again though sweet though heavn it may be death to thee farewell and blessings on thy way whereer thou goest beloved stranger better to sit and watch that ray and think thee safe though far away than have thee near me and in danger water no matter how much there is still not enough cunning life keeps asking for more and then a drop more our ankles are weighted with lead we delve under the wave we bend to our spades we survive the force of the gusher our bodies fountain with sweat in the deeps of the sea our forehead aches and holds like a sunken prow we are out of breath divining the heart of the geyser constellations are bobbing like corks above on the swell earth is a waterwheel the buckets go up and go down but to keep the whole aqueous architecture standing its ground we must make a ring with our bodies and dance out a round on the dreamt eye of water the dreamt eye of water the dreamt eye of water water no matter how much there is still not enough come rain come thunder come deluged dams washed away our thirst is unquenchable a cloud in the waters a siren we become two shades deliquescent drowning in song my love under the tall sky of hope our love and our love alone keeps dowsing for water sinking the well of each other digging together each one the others phantom limb in the sea like the idalian queen her hair about her eyne with neck and breasts ripe apples to be seen at first glance of the morn in cyprus gardens gathering those fair flowers which of her blood were born i saw but fainting saw my paramours the graces naked danced about the place the winds and trees amazed with silence on her gazed the flowers did smile like those upon her face and as their aspen stalks those fingers band that she might read my case a hyacinth i wished me in her hand i let me speak with expressive hesitation a feeling for interment why even lineate what isnt broken by music let me speak with inextricable reluctance i want to tear the heart from refused convalescence feed it those long fronds of river bed grass i want to tear the heart out of style put it between utter thrall the infancy of all things impure torn out a flame thickens between us as if not right now well be ripped from this life or each other a white lie not a little more tender than quick inextricable reluctance to die or even leave youth culture ever what a stupid feeling do you think it isnt true the very existence of flame throwers proves that sometime somewhere someone said to themselves you know i want to set those people over there on fire but im just not close enough to get the job done someone puts their arms around you in the cold theres an al most disquieting closeness as gossamer clots becomes an impasto derivative of some newly visible interdependence flame throwers then are just a description of prevailing ideology relics the life of the party a soul flirts by burning that name for itself up in jonesing that comes at the end of desire well i wouldnt know about that a little goat why would it nuzzle dreamily up the way i nuzzle dreamily up to my knees in the fatal position as my nephew used to call it estranged from play waiting on the fox hunt oh baby it beats up my lips the somatic effects of contriving a psychic blockade against death with the contours of your face healing in constant eclipse where all things inextricably broken by music make the basic rhythmic unit go something like this i dont want to loose you i dont want to be empty clever hold keep you i was lost to you to start with still i keep on coming back do you think youll keep on coming back to me forever thats the meaning of our life together baby he slid the stiff blade up to my ear oh fear this should have been thirst a cheapening act but i lacked as usual the crucial disbelief sticky cold a billfoldwet in my mouth wrists bound by his belt i feltlike the boy in a briny night pool he who foundthe drownedbody yet still somehow swam with an unknown joy that boy you and i thigh deep in suwannee river then in a bathtub spanish moss clogs the drain and a man carrying a green towel interrupts we send him away once more knowing hell return to watch were photographers shooting on location for sylvia plaths upcoming book savage beauty wrong poet or wrong book i know depending on how you look at it however im the one who is white this time youre darker maybe quechua indian or spanish like actor antonio banderas with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis years later i write a book about our affair they bring me on one of those daytime talk shows and before being reunited we are kept in separate rooms the television split screen green towel man in the audience im still white so are you both of us middle aged with freckles and strawberry blonde hair later im the viewer at home thinking like hell theyll fall for each other so so breake off this last lamenting kisse which sucks two soules and vapours both away turne thou ghost that way and let mee turne this and let our selves benight our happiest day we askd none leave to love nor will we owe any so cheape a death as saying goe goe and if that word have not quite kild thee ease mee with death by bidding mee goe too oh if it have let my word worke on mee and a just office on a murderer doe except it be too late to kill me so being double dead going and bidding goe as if engineparts could bewrenched outat random andthe car would still start andsound even hearts can gowith chambersbroken open in fort wayne i drank the seniors old milwaukee old crow in indianapolis i stopped now i regret every drink i never took all around coffee grounds and eggshells this sweating a mouthful of lime as a boy i stole a mint green bra from a laundromat i took it home to try on while my parents slept filled its cups with the smallest turnips in our pantry the underwire grew into me like a strangler fig my blood roiled then as now back on earth frogspit is dripping down wild aloe spikes salmon are bullying their way upstream there is a pond i leapt into once with a lonely blonde boy when we scampered out one of us was in love i could not be held responsible for desire he could not be held at all i wonder where he is now if he looked up he might see me a sparkling i always hoped that when i died i would know why my brother will be so sad he will tell his daughter i was better than i was he will leave out my crueldrunk nights the wet mattresses my driving alone into cornfields unsure whether id drive out i wish he were here now he could be here this cave is big enough for everyone look at all the diamonds in one dream i am made watchful in this dream the name we never clearly have heard is spoken which name if we knew and could speak it would call back to us those whom in time we will have come to love and who will die would bring them back to us like us abandoned again to his terrible consequence the silence between us forever affirmed and in whatever might constitute the pardon would come down in a fragile rain the whole matter of all we will ever love the whole fiery blade of space ten billions of suns suddenly blossoming small and cool as snowdrops over the opening graves the world shimmering with the blue delicate membrane of the fallen sky while above us the forsaken voice calls out come back come back as if calling the name each of us had long forgotten until that very instant not remembered as proper to our hearts the heart and service to you profferd with right good will full honestly refuse it not since it is offerd but take it to you gentlely and though it be a small present yet good consider graciously the thought the mind and the intent of him that loves you faithfully it were a thing of small effect to work my woe thus cruelly for my good will to be abject therefore accept it lovingly pain or travel to run or ride i undertake it pleasantly bid ye me go and straight i glide at your commandement humbly pain or pleasure now may you plant even which it please you steadfastly do which you list i shall not want to be your servant secretly and since so much i do desire to be your own assuredly for all my service and my hire reward your servant liberally so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own hearts home as to his queen some victor knight of fa ry earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light the toil which stole from thee so many an hour is ended and the fruit is at thy feet no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet water falls leap among wild islands green which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of moss grown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass i do remember well the hour which burst my spirits sleep a fresh may dawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near school room voices that alas were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check i then controuled my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my minda sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clog until revived by thee thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long no more alone through the worlds wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath lifes beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to methe parents of the song i consecrate to thee is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence neer to sound again though it might shake the anarch customs reign and charm the minds of men to truths own sway holier than was amphions i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey and what art thou i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth of glorious parents thou aspiring child i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desart hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and low thoughted cares like thunder stricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwelling place truths deathless voice pauses among mankind if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the worlds tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seamans sight that burn from year to year with unextinguished light he came in his seedy brown jacket smelling of paint all thumbs a man stumbling over his own muscles unable to hold some part of himself and rock it gently she gave up seeing him come in the door wanting to show him her flat belly just an hour before looking at her own corpse in the mirror she lay there reduced neither virgin nor mother it had been decided the winter was too cold in the garage they would live with her mother the old bedroom was already prepared cleaned the door opened the solitary twin bed remained he would sleep on the porch she looked at him and tried to feel her way into the body of a woman a thing which has to be taken care of held safely in his arms she lay there trying to hold on to what she had knowing she had to let it go all the new thinking is about loss in this it resembles all the old thinking the idea for example that each particular erases the luminous clarity of a general idea that the clown faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk of that black birch is by his presence some tragic falling off from a first world of undivided light or the other notion that because there is in this world no one thing to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds a word is elegy to what it signifies we talked about it late last night and in the voice of my friend there was a thin wire of grief a tone almost querulous after a while i understood that talking this way everything dissolves justice pine hair woman you and i there was a woman i made love to and i remembered how holding her small shoulders in my hands sometimes i felt a violent wonder at her presence like a thirst for salt for my childhood river with its island willows silly music from the pleasure boat muddy places where we caught the little orange silver fish called pumpkinseed it hardly had to do with her longing we say because desire is full of endless distances i must have been the same to her but i remember so much the way her hands dismantled bread the thing her father said that hurt her what she dreamed there are moments when the body is as numinous as words days that are the good flesh continuing such tenderness those afternoons and evenings saying blackberry blackberry blackberry i was always afraid of the next card the psychic would turn over for us forgive me for not knowinghow we wereevery card in the deck you that do search for every purling spring which from the ribs of old parnassus flows and every flower not sweet perhaps which grows near thereabouts into your poesy wring ye that do dictionarys method bring into your rimes running in rattling rows you that poor petrarchs long deceased woes with new born sighs and denizend wit do sing you take wrong ways those far fet helps be such as do bewray a want of inward touch and sure at length stoln goods do come to light but if both for your love and skill your name you seek to nurse at fullest breasts of fame stella behold and then begin to endite my wifes bare footprints on these rocks after shes been swimming where the river has dug a small pool by the road outside bearsville it looks like rain no its raining should i follow these delicate marks to find her no shes just ten feet away and she turns back green bathing suit thin legs orange and black towel it stops raining her footprints going away have evaporated but of course she makes new ones heading toward me there are certain moments you stay in even as theyre gone like wet prints on rock or the way you cannot forget your dead friends spiked sun the hudsons whittled down by ice i hear the bone dice of blown gravel clicking bone pale the recent snow fastens like fur to the river standstill we were leaving to deliver christmas presents when the tire blew last year above the dead valves pines pared down by a storm stood limbs bared i want you where does such tenderness come from these arent the first curlsive wound around my finger ive kissed lips darker than yours the sky is washed and dark where does such tenderness come from other eyes have knownand shifted away from my eyes but ive never heard words like thisin the night where does such tenderness come from with my head on your chest rest where does this tenderness come from and what will i do with it youngstranger poet wandering through town you and your eyelashes longer than anyones so oft as i her beauty do behold and therewith do her cruelty compare i marvel of what substance was the mould the which her made at once so cruel fair not earth for her high thoughts more heavenly are not water for her love doth burn like fire not air for she is not so light or rare not fire for she doth freeze with faint desire then needs another element inquire whereof she might be made that is the sky for to the heaven her haughty looks aspire and eke her love is pure immortal high then since to heaven ye likened are the best be like in mercy as in all the rest herodotus says the king made a bowl to leave behind the memory of a number we dont know the number we dont know if it was divisible by two or three i want at the moment the number to indicate a ratio part of a proportion because the measurement of the earth depends on this the balance among things the snow at the bottom of the hill the gold garage light caged in a tree my love for my friend and the distance between us which i cant bear i made a pinhole camera to demonstrate proportion and everything bright hovers on its milky eye and here is the catalogue of what hovers there smaller than itself the blue horizon and the dash at the stoplight a shell night light the gazing ball of the sun going down against the white back fence which made it look like night in the woods lit from underneath on the wax i held these things yesterday along with two pearls that are spheres hanging from my living room ceiling my friend is smaller now and if i held my camera up to her she would give off enough light to hover pocket sized in my hand and grand in the world whoso list to hunt i know where is an hind but as for me h las i may no more the vain travail hath wearied me so sore i am of them that farthest cometh behind yet may i by no means my wearied mind draw from the deer but as she fleeth afore fainting i follow i leave off therefore sithens in a net i seek to hold the wind who list her hunt i put him out of doubt as well as i may spend his time in vain and graven with diamonds in letters plain there is written her fair neck round about noli me tangere for caesars i am and wild for to hold though i seem tame it once might have been once only we lodged in a street together you a sparrow on the housetop lonely i a lone she bird of his feather your trade was with sticks and clay you thumbed thrust patted and polished then laughed they will see some day smith made and gibson demolished my business was song song song i chirped cheeped trilled and twittered kate browns on the boards ere long and grisis existence embittered i earned no more by a warble than you by a sketch in plaster you wanted a piece of marble i needed a music master we studied hard in our styles chipped each at a crust like hindoos for air looked out on the tiles for fun watched each others windows you lounged like a boy of the south cap and blouse nay a bit of beard too or you got it rubbing your mouth with fingers the clay adhered to and i soon managed to find weak points in the flower fence facing was forced to put up a blind and be safe in my corset lacing no harm it was not my fault if you never turned your eyes tail up as i shook upon e in alt or ran the chromatic scale up for spring bade the sparrows pair and the boys and girls gave guesses and stalls in our street looked rare with bulrush and watercresses why did not you pinch a flower in a pellet of clay and fling it why did not i put a power of thanks in a look or sing it i did look sharp as a lynx and yet the memory rankles when models arrived some minx tripped up stairs she and her ankles but i think i gave you as good that foreign fellow who can know how she pays in a playful mood for his tuning her that piano could you say so and never say suppose we join hands and fortunes and i fetch her from over the way her piano and long tunes and short tunes no no you would not be rash nor i rasher and something over youve to settle yet gibsons hash and grisi yet lives in clover but you meet the prince at the board im queen myself at bals par ive married a rich old lord and youre dubbed knight and an r a each life unfulfilled you see it hangs still patchy and scrappy we have not sighed deep laughed free starved feasted despaired been happy and nobody calls you a dunce and people suppose me clever this could but have happened once and we missed it lost it for ever shepherdboy not the most salient image for contemporary readers nor most available unless youre thinking brokeback mountain a reference already escaping i did love a montana man though no good shepherd rather a caveman came spelunking into that grotto id retreated to what light he bore illumined such small space physically temporally and did he have a grove of beech trees no no grove but together we found an old growth stand of redwood we gouged each others chests instead of wood pledges that faded he was not cruel nor i unwitting but what endures beyond any thicket example he took me to the ocean to say farewell i mean me farewell to ocean the ocean for that matter to me us both fatigued showing signs of wreckage and that man i had loved stood back from the edge of things he did not hold me i expected not to be held we all understood one another shepherd understudy ocean me and did he go back to his fields and caves yes but they were gone strip mining lumber defoliant sterile streams you knew that was coming werent we taught some starched sermon the pasture awaits us elsewhere back up a moment the forest you mentioned remember instead of a grove untouched for the most part some human damage but not ours we left no mark not there in the midst of those great trees not in the concentric rings that might have held us far past living instead i put that man like so many others on paper a tree already gone from sight where once it had drawn the eyes upward the crest of a mountain crumpled thoughts crumpled love shepherdboy do you see the wild fennel bulbs i gathered for you olallieberries new mown grass the tender fruits of the coastal fig i put them on paper too so fragile for nothing is ever going to last for haines eason i run high in my body on the road toward sea i fall in love the things the wind is telling me the yellow sky quiet in her quiet dress old birds sending news from the reddish hills the one hawk flying in the distance overhead that hawk is what the wind says in love with the heaving of my peacock chest with my lungs two wings such flying things but mine for now just for now as i open my stride above the good dirt road fall in love with the mustard coriander dust the far far mountain beveled by light by rain the easy eye of the sun now smoke floating across the hillside like a face i knew once very well very well i fall in love with the flowers the wash hung like prayer flags see in red juanitas yard in love with the earth the color of earth in love with the goats their bellies hooves the goat mouths bleating as they greet me on the road i fall in love how they wear their strange double eyes how they do not blink or laugh at me or say a thing i understand when i ask them in my english because they circle around my feet as if they always knew me were you my children once did i know your names oh little magics little children even if we wont admit it getting off the subway at canal st i wonder if the author is a man or a woman a teen a team as virtuous men pass mildly away and whisper to their souls to go whilst some of their sad friends do say the breath goes now and some say no so let us melt and make no noise no tear floods nor sigh tempests move twere profanation of our joys to tell the laity our love moving of th earth brings harms and fears men reckon what it did and meant but trepidation of the spheres though greater far is innocent dull sublunary lovers love whose soul is sense cannot admit absence because it doth remove those things which elemented it but we by a love so much refined that our selves know not what it is inter assured of the mind care less eyes lips and hands to miss our two souls therefore which are one though i must go endure not yet a breach but an expansion like gold to airy thinness beat if they be two they are two so as stiff twin compasses are two thy soul the fixed foot makes no show to move but doth if the other do and though it in the center sit yet when the other far doth roam it leans and hearkens after it and grows erect as that comes home such wilt thou be to me who must like th other foot obliquely run thy firmness makes my circle just and makes me end where i begun theres a black bear in the apple tree and he wont come down i can hear him panting like an athlete i can smell the stink of his body come down black bear can you hear me the mind is the most interesting thing to me like the sudden death of the sun it seems implausible that darkness will swallow it or that anything is lost forever there like a black bear in a fruit tree gulping up sour apples with dry sucking sounds or like us at the pier somber and tired making food from sunlight you saying a word me saying a word trying hard though things were disintegrating still i wanted you your lips on my neck your postmodern sexuality forlorn and anonymous i didnt want to be that i could hear the great barking monsters of the lower waters calling me forward you see my mind takes me far but my heart dreams of return black bear with pale pink tongue at the center of his face is turning his head like the face of christ from life shaking the apple boughs he is stronger than i am and seems so free of passion no fear no pain no tenderness i want to be that come down black bear i want to learn the faith of the indifferent my heart is a fancy place where giant reddish purple cauliflowers white ones in french english are outside waiting to welcome you to a boat over the low black river for a big dinner theres alot of choice among the foods even a tortured lamb served in pieces en croute on a plate so hot as a rack of clouds blown over the cold filthy river we are entitled to see anytime while we use the tablecovers to love each other publicly dishing out imitative luxuries to show off poetrys extreme generosity then home in the heart of a big limousine what may the woman labour to confess there is about her mouth a nervous twitch tis something to be told or hidden which i get a glimpse of hell in this mild guess she has desires of touch as if to feel that all the household things are things she knew she stops before the glass what sight in view a face that seems the latest to reveal for she turns from it hastily and tossed irresolute steals shadow like to where i stand and wavering pale before me there her tears fall still as oak leaves after frost she will not speak i will not ask we are league sundered by the silent gulf between yon burly lovers on the village green yours is a lower and a happier star i just dont think that this is what its supposed to feel like shaking my big one to break the stream and make a pool for moving my tools for they only weigh half as much when moved under water i emerged in the morning covered in blood and fine acid sand and decided to remain partially submerged a little while longer itching for more exercise and cooled not by water but by air i spent the afternoon collecting sea shells and found each one heavily carved with the numbers of pretty village girls offering to take tourists to the ultimate level a spring and summer service they offer i meant to call one with a headline ready on my lips but a gull would dive down wheeling and screaming each time i tried to dial one can fool the animals but must forgive this wild beautiful country blood to babe to fathers laden table dance said the father show us your grace whose tattered cotton whose weary gristle heads duly shriven wrenched in complaint cleft so a heart works without wanting summoned to pleasure free to pick dates curve into cursive praxis to ashes what reveler considers the number of plates beneath all this im carving a cathedralof salt i keepthe entrance hidden no one seems to noticethe hours im missing illbring you one night its wherei go when ihang up the phone neither younor your soul is waiting for me atthe end of this i know that the saltnearly clear after ichisel out the pews the see throughaltar the opaquepanes of glass that depict the stations ofour cross here is the daywe met here is the day we remember wemet the air down herewill kill us some say some wear papermasks some still imagine the air above the greentrees thick with beesbuilding solitary nests out of petals whatsthe name for this ineffable the endlesswhite will blind you some say but what is there to see we havent alreadyseen some say itslike poking a stick into a river you might as wellsimply write about the stick or the river a girl her soul a deep wave pearl dim lucent of all lovely mysteries a face flowered for hearts ease a brows grace soft as seas seen through faint forest trees a mouth the lips apart like aspen leaflets trembling in the breeze from her tempestuous heart such and our souls so knit i leave a page half writ the work begun will be to heavens conception done if she come to it what stays in doesnt come out nipples hard with milk when things are of another time they are of that time not timeless they are no longer here nipples hard with liquid or falsities white and soft i cant get it out no matter how hard i yank or pull and suck face watching with my own nipple in my mouth like the room shes in i went and i seduced but no matter what i couldnt get her to leave aqua and in the morning coffee the bathroom gold and green no matter what i said she stayed there she had her own fantasies to wait for milk that never comes out it grows inside does it fold back in time i want to say it becomes different the man who grafted another face what poems i wrote for him no i want to say that when you came at me with the syringe that i loved you in gold and green you came at me revision upon revision of your love it wasnt like you to give up i knocked and knocked and you went back into your doorway what days the nipples rising with future things to come what happened to those thoughts to those people i loved that woman in the building sunset road the place with the dead babies but no matter what i did how hard i yanked she would never leave i knocked and knocked no matter what i did or said i just couldnt get her out of there clownlike happiest on your hands feet to the stars and moon skulled gilled like a fish a common sense thumbs down on the dodos mode wrapped up in yourself like a spool trawling your dark as owls do mute as a turnip from the fourth of july to all fools day o high riser my little loaf vague as fog and looked for like mail farther off than australia bent backed atlas our traveled prawn snug as a bud and at home like a sprat in a pickle jug a creel of eels all ripples

set shep oh it is she whose sweets do stain the lily rose the violet shep why doth the sun against his kind fix his bright chariot in the skies shep because the sun is stricken blind with looking on her heavenly eyes shep why do thy flocks forbear their food which sometime were thy chief delight shep because they need no other good that live in presence of her sight shep why look these flowers so pale and ill that once attired this goodly heath shep she hath robbd nature of her skill and sweetens all things with her breath shep why slide these brooks so slow away whose bubbling murmur pleased thine ear shep oh marvel not although they stay when they her heavenly voice do hear shep from whence come all these shepherd swains and lovely nymphs attired in green shep from gathering garlands on the plains to crown our fair the shepherds queen both the sun that lights this world below flocks flowers and brooks will witness bear these nymphs and shepherds all do know that it is she is only fair you left me sire two legacies a legacy of love a heavenly father would suffice had he the offer of you left me boundaries of pain capacious as the sea between eternity and time your consciousness and me he frightens all the witches and the dragons in their lair he cues the clear blue daylight and he gives the night its dare he flaps his wings for warning and he struts atop a mare for when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee in his coal black plumage and his bright red crown and his golden beaked fury and his calculated frown in his webbed footed glory he sends jehovah down for when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee o they dance around the fire and they boil the gall of wolves and they sing their strange crude melodies and play their weirder tunes and the villagers close their windows and the grave yard starts to heave and the cross wont help their victims and the screaming fills the night and the young girls die with open eyes and the skies are lavender light but when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee well the sheriff is getting desperate as they go their natures way killing cattle smothering infants slaughtering those who block their way and the countryside swarms with numbness as their magic circle grows but when he crows they tremble and when he comes they flee posting hex signs on their wagons simple worried farmers pray passing laws and faking justice only feed the witches brew violet stones are rendered helpless drunken priests are helpless too but when he crows they quiver and when he comes they flee we have seen them in their ritual we have catalogued their crimes we are weary of their torture but we cannot bring them down their ancient hoodoo enemy who does the work the trick strikes peril in their dead fiends hearts and pecks their flesh to quick love him feed him he will never let you down for when he crows they quiver and when he comes they frown dead love by treason slain lies stark white as a dead stark stricken dove none that pass by him pause to mark dead love his heart that strained and yearned and strove as toward the sundawn strives the lark is cold as all the old joy thereof dead men re arisen from dust may hark when rings the trumpet blown above it will not raise from out the dark dead love again this morning my eyes woke up too close to your eyes their almost green orbs too heavy lidded to really look back to wake up next to you is ordinary i do not even need to look at you to see you but i do look so when you come to me in your opulent sadness i see you do not want me to unbutton you so i cannot do the one thing i can do now it is almost one a m i am still at my desk and you are upstairs at your desk a staircase away from me already it is years of you a staircase away from me to be near you and not near you is ordinary you are ordinary still how many afternoons have i spent peeling blue paint from our porch steps peering above hedgerows the few parked cars for the first glimpse of you how many hours under the overgrown pink camillas thinking the color was wrong for you thinking youd appear after my next blink soon youll come down the stairs to tell me something and ill say okay okay ill say it like that say it just like that ill go on being your never enough its not the best in you i long for its when youre noteless numb at the ends of my fingers all is all i say it is even when your friend the radio is still even when her dream the magazine is finished even when his life the ticker is silent even when their destiny the boulevard is bare and after that paradise the dance hall is closed after that theater the clinic is dark still there will be your desire and hers and his hopes and theirs your laughter their laughter your curse and his curse her reward and their reward their dismay and his dismay and her dismay and yours even when your enemy the collector is dead even when your counsellor the salesman is sleeping even when your sweetheart the movie queen has spoken even when your friend the magnate is gone
